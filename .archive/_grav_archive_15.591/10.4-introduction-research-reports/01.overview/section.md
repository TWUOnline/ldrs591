## Unit 4: An Introduction to Research Reports
### Overview

In unit 4 we are going to find out more information about research reports. To start, we will focus on understanding the common elements found in the introduction of research reports. We will be engaging with the research problem, the review of precedent literature, and the research purpose. Although the terms “research problem” and “research purpose” sound similar, we will see that although related, they are quite different.

### Topics

Unit 4 is divided into 4 topics:

1. What is Servant Leadership?
2. What is a Research Problem?
3. What is a Literature Review?
4. What is the Research Purpose?



### Learning Outcomes

When you have completed this unit you should be able to:

1.  Compare and contrast the common elements of a quantitative research question and a qualitative research question.
2.  Evaluate the quality of the research problem, literature review, and purpose statement of a research report on servant leadership.
3.  Reflect on the importance of understanding the introduction section of a research report for a critical consumer of research.
