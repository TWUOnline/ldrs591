### Unit 6 Assessment

### Prepare for your Discussion

While you read the methods and findings sections, you will evaluate these sections using the criteria provided in the Plano-Clark and Creswell text for the research design, participants and data collection, and findings.  

**_You will prepare a short summary of your evaluation and post it on the Unit 6 forum. Remember to provide the title of your article in your summary._**
