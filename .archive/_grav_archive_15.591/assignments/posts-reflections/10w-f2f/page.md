## Discussion Posts and Responses ###

In an online class, discussion posts are the main way students and professors interact with the course’s ideas and lessons. The best discussion posts demonstrate an understanding of the course material and present a cohesive argument with evidence to back it up. The following tips can help you generate an effective post, to engage your classmates and elicit thoughtful responses from your instructor and classmates.

1.	Complete the assigned learning activities that are provided in each unit and complete the readings before you start writing your post. As you are reading, make connections between the text and your own life.
2.	Read the prompts carefully.  For example, what question or required reading are you being asked to respond to? What is the word limit? When is the due date and time? What sources are you expected to draw on? Are you being asked to reflect on personal experience, determine a solution to a problem, compare two ideas, or make an argument? What formatting has your instructor requested? If no specific formatting is indicated, follow general APA guidelines.
3.	Develop your thoughts and support your statements with evidence from the course materials. Be concise and articulate your ideas thoroughly.
4.	Include personal or professional experience (when it’s applicable), and support your ideas with evidence. Offer real-world application of these ideas to bring added value to the conversation and resonate with other students.
5.	Prepare your response in a word document before you post. By doing this, you’ll have a better chance to ensure the post is cohesive, coherent, and complete. Make sure to check all spelling and grammar. Just because it’s a discussion post doesn’t mean it should be messy.
6.	Post your response, engage with your classmates, and continue to ask follow-up questions. Be an integral part of the conversation and add value to what is being discussed. Some of the best online discussions continue in the minds of others long after you post to the discussion forum. So the next time you post, ask yourself: What can I write that will add value to the conversation?
7.	You do not have to reply to all of your colleagues posts. However, you should make an effort to read through your colleagues posts and respond to a minimum of two posts. Your replies should offer new substantiated ideas or thoughtful questions. Feel free to respond to more questions if you want to.

- _Substantive responses may include:_
  •	Providing a new thought, idea, or perspective;
  •	Citing an experience or example of what we are learning;
  •	Adding a new twist on a perspective;
  •	Critically thinking about an idea/concept;
  •	Questioning or challenging a principle/perspective;
  •	Asking a question or making a comment that shows you are interested in what another person says or encourages another person to elaborate on something they have already said;
  •	Sharing a resource (a reading, web link, video) not covered in the syllabus that adds new information or perspectives to our learning;
  •	Making a comment that underscores the link between two people’s contributions and making this link explicit in your comment. Or making a summary observation that takes into account several people’s contributions and that touches on a recurring theme in the discussion.

- _What Substantive Participation is NOT:_
  •	Very basic comments such as “I agree” or “I disagree;”
  •	Restating what has been said (unless there is a direct purpose in doing so);
  •	Disrespectfully disagreeing;
  •	Pat answers that are not thought-provoking or do not move the dialogue forward;
  •	Greetings/conversation better suited for the Virtual Collegium.

- _Below are examples of how to stimulate your own and others’ thinking:_
  •	What would happen if…
  •	Other times it may be helpful to…
  •	It is my understanding…what is your experience with this?
  •	You might approach this from…
  •	Is it possible that…
  •	Would you consider…
  •	Maybe…
  •	Possibly…
  •	Sometimes…
  •	I’m wondering if…
  •	Do you think…
