# <!--Assignment 1:--> Literature Search

The purpose of this assignment is to develop your skills to search, retrieve, and begin reviewing relevant literature. This assignment will include the “paper trail” that provides the details of your search for relevant literature. In order to complete this assignment you will need to:

*   Identify your research question and key search terms.
*   Use search strategies to locate and select literature.
*   Create a table that summarizes information from your search results.
*   Use APA 7 formatting requirements.

#### Step 1: Identify your research topic.
In one paragraph (3-5 sentences), provide a general but engaging introduction that describes the context of the problem you are investigating. What generated your interest in this topic? What problem does your topic address?  

Next, in one paragraph (3-5 sentences) write a brief statement outlining your personal/professional interest in this topic. You will want to describe the relevant issues included in your problem statement, including the urgency, the controversies, and anything else that will convince your reader that your problem is worth pursuing. Why do you think your topic is important? Conclude this section with the specific research question you will be investigating.

#### Step 2: Conduct a search for scholarly articles on your topic.
1.	Identify the searchable keywords that arise from your problem statement and then search for **_5 scholarly articles_ ** on your research topic. Record your search terms.
2.	Begin your search by starting broadly. Using your keywords, search the Library One Search engine found at the [TWU Library](https://www.twu.ca/library). This search will yield all sources of information related to your topic. From this search, identify key sources that you have found to be relevant to your research question.  Make a note of these sources by saving this information in a word document or another electronic format.
3.	Next, you will conduct a search of at least two academic databases using your keywords. The list of academic databases can be found here at the [TWU Article Databases](http://libguides.twu.ca/articles). You will need to identify key academic journal articles that you have found to be relevant to your research question.  Examples of academic databases are Academic Search Ultimate and Business Source Complete.
4.	Finally, move into the literature available on the internet by conducting a search using a search engine such as [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/) or the [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/). You will need to identify credible sources that you have found to be relevant to your research question.

#### Step 3: Summarize your procedure.
In one paragraph (5-7 sentences), describe how you chose your particular articles. In other words, what procedures did you follow and what inclusion and exclusion criteria did you use to keep and eliminate articles. For example, the inclusion criteria may include the following elements: peer-reviewed, publication range, language, how you accessed the information. The exclusion criteria may include the following factors: an article/book that does not meet the inclusion criteria, and non-English full-text studies were excluded even if an English translation of the abstract was provided. See the **template** provided in a link below for an example of the "procedure" section.

#### Step 4: Create a summary table of your literature search results.
In a table, you will summarize the information you have collected from step 2. Complete a summary of each relevant article you found in a matrix table like the one below (change headings to suit your needs).  Please note: this will take you the most time, so make sure you set aside enough time to read through the abstracts of the articles to fill in the criteria in the table below.  Here is a helpful video explaining [How to Read an Academic Paper](https://youtu.be/SKxm2HF_-k0).
