## <!--Assignment #4:--> Action Research Presentation

Using one of the practical problems you identified from the learning activities in Unit 8, create an idea for action research project following the steps described by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015, pp. 440-442):

1. Determine if an action research project is feasible. Remember, you want to use action research when you want to systematically address a practical problem in your work situation or community, and to advance your own professional development.
2. Specify the problem you want to study. Identify the question you want to answer. The most important factor in action research is that you need to solve a practical problem. This problem is one that you face in your own practice or in your community. 
3. Identify the information that you need. This means that you need to decide who your participants will be, how many people you will study, how you will access these participants.  Be specific. 
4. Describe how you will collect data.  Your choices are to collect quantitative data (e.g., attendance data, test scores, or a short survey) or qualitative data (e.g., reflection journals or in-person interviews, focus groups) or both.
5. How will you analyze the data that you collect?  Will you use quantitative, numerical data that will be examined using descriptive analyses or qualitative, text-based data using content analyses exploring general themes. 
6. In action research, it is not enough to produce results from your data, you need to use  those results to develop a plan for action. Describe how the results of this project will help enhance the lives of those involved.

7. Finally, describe how you are going to implement your plan. You also need to reflect on what you have learned from implementing your plan and discuss how you will share your results with others.



Next, record your idea in a podcast or video so that it can be presented to your colleagues. Your introduction should include your key problem and explain the structure of your presentation. Your project idea should relate to a practical leadership issue you are currently facing. Your project idea should be clear and well organized. Your presentation should only be 3-5 minutes in length but no more than 6 minutes. Provide a conclusion that gives a call to action.

***Upload your audio file to soundcloud.com, tapewrite.com, or video file to Youtube or Microsoft Streams or another suitable online service and add your link the Unit 8 discussion forum.***

#### Here is some information on recording and sharing audio (from the TWU Online Orientation).

We will recommend that you sign up for some different web services in order to host your audio files. Please remember that you are not required to sign up for these services with your real name. Feel free to use a pseudonym or alias.

**[Anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm)** is a free smartphone app for either iOS or Android (you can also upload from your computer) that allows users to quickly and easily record, upload, and share audio files. Keep in mind that ‘ease-of-use’ often means ‘limited options’, and this is certainly the case with anchor.fm. There is very little that you can do to edit your recordings after the fact, so you may have to record multiple times.

Take a few minutes to download the app, or go to the site on your computer, and listen to some of the recordings that are posted there, then record a clip or two yourself.

**[Soundcloud.com](https://soundcloud.com/)** is another free (with a paid ‘Pro’ option) service that allows you to record and upload audio files. One advantage of SoundCloud is that it is extremely easy to embed a file in WordPress. All you need to do is copy/paste the URL from your uploaded file into its own line in a WordPress post or page, and WordPress will automatically display a SoundCloud player and embed the file into your post.

Create an account at Soundcloud and record or upload a clip.

**[TapeWrite.com](https://tapewrite.com/tapes/top)** is yet another free-with-pro-options.

**[Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/)** is an open source audio editing tool.

##### How to share your audio file:

Once you have created and uploaded your audio files share your presentation as a link in the discussion forum.

**Reminder:** Make sure you take some time to practice what you are going to say (I highly recommend creating a script) and give yourself lots of time to record, make mistakes, re-record, make more mistakes, take a break, re-record and then post it on the discussion forum.

### **Peer Review Instructions**

For this assignment, you will be asked to peer-review a presentation by a colleague in the class.  You will be assigned a peer-review partner for this evaluation.  Your peer-review should be collegial and address issues like quality of arguments and evidence as well as the structure and organization of the presentation. Your feedback to your partner should be 150-250 words and should be posted as a reply on their forum post in Unit 8.

**Peer Review Protocol**

Your instructor will assign partners for the peer-reviewed assignment and post the partnerships for you. Here is a link for the [peer-review partners and the evaluation criteria](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lNNUbVRrz0Ka6OXKOl089lyQWrFfA0Pm5l0IjRZx5M/edit?usp=sharing) for how you will peer-review the presentations.

**Please remember!**

- Be Kind: Always treat others with dignity and respect. Never use words that are hurtful, including sarcasm.
- Be Specific: Focus on particular strengths and weaknesses, rather than making general comments like “It’s good” or “I like it.” Provide insight into why it is good or what, specifically, you like about it.
- Be Helpful: The goal is to positively contribute to the individual or the group, not to simply be heard. Echoing the thoughts of others or cleverly pointing out details that are irrelevant wastes time.
- Participate: Peer critique is a process to support each other, and your feedback is valued!
- When critiquing a peer’s work, use “I” statements. For example, “I’m confused by this part,” rather than “This part makes no sense.”
- Use questions whenever possible. For example
- I’m curious why you chose to begin with…?
- Did you consider adding…?
- What evidence do you have for...?
- Remember the three important phrases:
- "I notice...".
- "I wonder...".
- "If this were my work, I would...".
