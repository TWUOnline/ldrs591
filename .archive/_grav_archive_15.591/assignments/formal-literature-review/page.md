# <!--Assignment 4:--> Formal Literature Review

In this assignment you will demonstrate your scholarly inquiry learning by writing a graduate-level literature review. This assignment is focused on the leadership interest you have identified and defined in the literature search, and your scholarly article review. This assignment will be your analysis and synthesis of the literature, presented in scholarly prose, fully compliant with APA (7th edition) format.

##### What type of literature review is required for this assignment?
The "type" or "style" of literature review that I am asking you to write for your fifth assignment is called a Traditional or Narrative Review. This type of review provides an overview of research on a particular topic that critiques and summarizes a body of literature. It is typically broad in focus. Relevant past research is selected and synthesized into a coherent discussion. Methodologies, findings and limits of the existing body of knowledge are discussed in narrative form. This type of review requires a sufficiently focused research question. You can find an excellent example of this type of literature review paper here:

> > > > Fear, W., & Erikson-Brown, A. (2014). Good quality discussion is necessary but not sufficient in asynchronous tuition: A brief narrative review of the literature.  Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks 18(2). Retrieved from [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1036265.pdf](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1036265.pdf)


##### How should you organize and write a literature review?

In their textbook, Fredericksen and Phelps (n.d.) outline the steps you need to take to write a literature review.  Begin by reading chapter 7 "Synthesizing Sources" and Chapter 8 "Writing a Literature Review".

Please note that I am NOT asking you to review ALL of the empirical evidence on your topic (this would be a huge undertaking). I am asking you to select a **minimum of 10 scholarly sources** that you will use to review for your paper. This means you are writing a literature review in **a maximum of 12 pages** (including title page, body of paper, reference list).

### Requirements for the Formal Literature Review Paper

##### Title page

Create a title page in APA format.

#### Introduction
The introduction of your paper should begin with one paragraph summarizing in general terms your research topic. This information should stand out and capture your reader’s attention. This introductory material should stand below the restated paper title without any further heading that indicates it is an introduction. In the next few paragraphs it is important to provide your reader with a brief overview of the problem. It is here that you want to begin to set the stage for your research story. You can build the overview by answering these questions in a few paragraphs:

- What was your research about? [Provide a general but engaging introduction that describes the context of your paper.]
- What generated your interest in this research?
- What problem does your research address?
- Why is your research important? How does your paper address the problem?
- What is the central research question?

It is important also to include the definition of any key terms that you will be using throughout your paper. Remember to include appropriate reference citations, and include any reference you cite in your paper in the reference list. On the basis of your personal knowledge as well as your investigation of the literature, provide a brief discussion of the major issues or gaps that have been identified related to the topic that is being investigated. This addresses the importance or the significance of your study. To conclude this section, provide a brief statement outlining the purpose of the study and be explicit about the research question you will be addressing. If you wish, you may also include a paragraph about your personal interest in this topic as a researcher. Here is a checklist of what you should include in this section:

- Identify the general topic.
-	Establish the importance of this topic to the field.
-	Establish your point of view or reason for interest in the topic.
-	Clarify key terms related to the topic.

#### Body (Critical Review of the Literature)
In this section you are now going to organize what you have learned by summarizing the major themes with full reference citations. Whether you choose to follow a study-by-study or a thematic approach, it is very important that you do not just simply recite a summary of the research report. The purpose of a literature review is to connect research reports to your stated problem through analysis and synthesis. Throughout this process you must critically appraise the relevance and value of the literature. The literature review should include major findings, and key conclusions, and a critical evaluation of the articles you have reviewed. When you are critically evaluating research studies, you are not just listing and summarizing items, you need to assess them, compare and contrast them, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each study that you have reviewed. Critically evaluate and integrate your findings in an unbiased and systematic way. Identify inconsistencies in study results and identify points of contention in theories, conceptualizations, and methods in the literature (Cooper, 2003).

**How to move from an article review to a paragraph in a literature review?**

Your task is to create a literature review that is synthesized from the individual research articles you have read and have taken notes on in Assignment 2 and 4. Part of that process revolves around the need to be able to look back at your notes and quickly see what you actually noted from these articles.  These notes will be included in any literature review you write. Create an article review for each article you collected for this final assignment. This will help you organize your findings and create the notes you need to write the paragraphs in the "results" section of your literature review paper.

Use the Article Review Template so that you can go back - after many weeks - and see your organized notes. Then, you literally organize your notes into the order you wish to present them, cut and paste things into a new word file that becomes your literature review, and then do the final cleaning up and additions.

**Writing an Introductory Paragraph**

After you have edited and revised your article review paragraphs, it’s time to write the Introductory Paragraph of your critical literature review.

This paragraph gives readers a sense of what’s coming. For example,

The question this review of literature addressed was, [XXXX]. This review of literature highlighted XX distinct themes including, a) XX, b) XX, and c) XX.

**Note:** *Remind your reader about your research question. Then give them an introduction to the themes you will be exploring.*

**Writing a Concluding Paragraph**

After you have edited and revised your article review paragraphs and organized them into themes, written the Introductory Paragraph, you are now ready to write the Concluding Paragraph of your findings.

The concluding paragraph gives readers a sense of what’s coming – for you. For example,

“To conclude, this review of literature suggested that researchers should …. (finish by adding your thoughts)….. “ or you state a conclusion about the similarities and differences in the articles you reviewed.

Here is a checklist of what you should include in this section:

*   Did you organize this section by themes or categories or chronologically?
*   Did you include at least 10 academic (peer-reviewed) sources?
*   Have you summarized and critically evaluated the articles you have reviewed?
-	Did you expand upon at least 2 main themes, each based upon multiple sources?
-	Did you synthesize consistencies across studies and within themes?
-	Did you discuss inconsistencies across studies and within themes?
-	Discuss the connection between the themes and the research question?
-	Did you write an introductory paragraph?
-	Did you write a concluding paragraph?


#### Discussion
In this section you should open by restating the problem you are investigating. You then want to state the major findings and discuss whether or not your literature review supported or did not support your research question. In this section you should describe your own interpretation of the research you reviewed (e.g., identify gaps, inconsistencies, strengths, weaknesses) and link these interpretations back to the question that you started with. You also need to discuss the limitations of your findings and make recommendations (and offer a rationale) for future research on the topic. End this section with a commentary on the importance of your findings and provide any implications that may result from the findings. Here is a checklist of what you should include in this section:

*  Provide a concise summary of the findings and conclusions in a balanced and impartial way.
*  What are the key strengths and/or limitations of the literature?
*  Offer a rationale for why future research should be conducted on this topic. What would you suggest based on the limitations?
*  Make recommendations for practice.

#### Conclusion

In this final section, you will bring your paper to a close. Consider the following questions as writing prompts for this final conclusion (Summarize in one short paragraph):

+ What was your research question?
+ What did you learn from your review of the literature?
+ Why do these results matter?
+ What is one final thought you think others need to know as a result of your work?

#### References

At the very end list your references. Reference lists must start on a new page, and must be formatted according to APA (7th edition) guidelines pertaining to which type of literature is being cited (i.e., book by one author, book with an editor, journal article, blog and so forth).
