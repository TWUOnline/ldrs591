# <!--Assignment 2:--> Article Critiques

In units 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 you will be learning about and critiquing different elements of a scholarly article.  In unit 4, you will focus on the introduction of an article. In unit 5, the focus will be on the methods and results of a quantitative research report.  In unit 6, the focus will be on the methods and results of a qualitative research report.  In unit 7, the focus will be on a mixed-methods report, and finally in unit 9, the focus will be on the conclusion of a research report. You will begin by reading the assigned article, then you evaluate the elements of the article assigned in each unit. The elements that you will evaluate will be different in each unit.

>>>>>> Note: You will spend time in class in your groups preparing the evaluation, and then will present your findings at the end of each class.
