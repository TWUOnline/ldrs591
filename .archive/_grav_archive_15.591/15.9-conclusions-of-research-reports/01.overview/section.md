## Unit 9: Conclusions of Research Reports
### Overview

In unit 9 we focus on assessing and interpreting the discussion/conclusion section of a research report. The discussion section is where loose threads are gathered together, and in particular, the author looks backward and distills into a few succinct paragraphs what the particular research has accomplished. All significant aspects of the research report are brought together in proper perspective, including relating the findings or results to the conclusions. Above all, a good discussion makes explicit how the findings or results support the conclusions.

### Topics

Unit 9 is divided into 3 topics:

1. The Conclusion Section of a Research Report
2. Comparing the Conclusion Section of Different Approaches to Research
3. Elements of Back Matter
4. Writing a Literature Review

### Learning Objectives

When you have completed this unit you should be able to:

1.  Discuss the similarities and differences in the discussion/conclusion section of a qualitative and quantitative research report.
2.  Evaluate the quality of the final sections of a research report on servant leadership.
3.  Apply what you have learned about the discussion/conclusion section of a research report to your own leadership context.
