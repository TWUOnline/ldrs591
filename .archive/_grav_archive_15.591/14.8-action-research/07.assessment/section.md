## Unit 8 Assessment

### Prepare your Presentation

In your learning pod/discussion post this week, you will spend most of your time preparing an action research project presentation. Make sure you all have time to share your project idea. This will be a brainstorming session so that you can get peer feedback on your project plan before you submit it. 

**Here are the instructions for developing your action research plan:** 

Think about some practical problems that you have faced in your professional life that you would like to change. Share one problem with your group that you would like to address for your action research project. Discuss why it is a problem and discuss why this problem is important to you. Next, you will create an idea for action research project following the steps outlined by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015, pp. 440-442) below.  Discuss the following steps with your group to provide each other with peer-feedback:

1. Determine if an action research project is feasible. Remember, you want to use action research when you want to systematically address a practical problem in your work situation or community, and to advance your own professional development.
2. Specify the problem you want to study. Identify the question you want to answer. The most important factor in action research is that you need to solve a practical problem. This problem is one that you face in your own practice or in your community. 
3. Identify the information that you need. This means that you need to decide who your participants will be, how many people you will study, how you will access these participants.  Be specific. 
4. Describe how you will collect data.  Your choices are to collect quantitative data (e.g., attendance data, test scores, or a short survey) or qualitative data (e.g., reflection journals or in-person interviews, focus groups) or both.
5. How will you analyze the data that you collect?  Will you use quantitative, numerical data that will be examined using descriptive analyses or qualitative, text-based data using content analyses exploring general themes. 
6. In action research, it is not enough to produce results from your data, you need to use  those results to develop a plan for action. Describe how the results of this project will help enhance the lives of those involved.

7. Finally, describe how you are going to implement your plan. You also need to reflect on what you have learned from implementing your plan and discuss how you will share your results with others.

### Complete Assignment #4: Scholarly Article Review

This assignment is the next step in moving toward a literature review paper. Remember, your eventual task is to create a literature review that is synthesized from the individual research articles you have read and have taken notes on in Assignment 2. Part of that process involves the need to be able to look back at your notes and quickly see what you actually noted from these articles.  For this assignment you will write a review of a journal article using the guidelines provided under the Assignment 4: Scholarly Article Review tab under the Assignments tab.

2. Can you design an action research project that might be utilized in your leadership practice?
3. Can you evaluate an action research project proposal?
