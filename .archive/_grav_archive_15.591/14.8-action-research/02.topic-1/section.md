### Topic 1: What is Action Research?
This week in Unit 8 you will get a chance to explore a new approach to research.  Action research "is a disciplined process of inquiry conducted _by_ and _for_ those taking the action" (Sagor, 2000, para. 1). Its purpose is to solve local/practical problems through the application of systematic investigation.  The problem is local, the investigation is local, and there is little concern for generalizing results to other settings. Action research may employ virtually any research methodology, and will commonly be conducted collaboratively with other professionals.  Action research differs from more formal research in some important ways that you will uncover in the readings this week.

Action research has been defined as “a form of applied research whose primary purpose is to increase the quality, impact, and justice” of professional practice (Gall, Gall & Borg, 2007, p. 597). Its purpose is to solve local problems through the application of systematic investigation. The problem is local, the investigation is local, and there is little concern for generalizing results to other settings. Gay (1987) states “the primary goal of action research is the solution of a given problem, not contribution to science” (p. 8). Action research may employ virtually any research methodology, and will commonly be conducted collaboratively with other professionals. Action research differs from more formal research in some important ways.

Formal research is typically conducted by researchers with a great deal of experience and/or training in research, and who wish to produce new, generalizable knowledge. Action research is typically conducted by those with much less experience in and knowledge of research, with the intention of solving a current, local problem. Formal research typically employs random or representative sampling techniques, while action research will typically employ convenience sampling. Formal research designs typically exhibit rigorous controls, with a long time frame, while action research designs display more casual procedures, often employing emergent designs, and are focused on short-term time frames (Gall, Gall & Borg 2007, p. 598). Action research can serve personal, professional, and political purposes.

At its heart, action research is cyclical in nature. Gill and Johnson (2002) assert that action research is a planned intervention by a researcher, or more often a consultant, into some natural social setting, such as an organization. The effects of that intervention are then monitored and evaluated with the aim of discerning whether or not that action has produced the expected consequences. In other words, the researcher acts upon his or her beliefs or theories in order to change the organization (Gill & Johnson, 2002, p. 71). Going back to Boyer’s model of scholarship, what distinguishes action research as research or scholarly inquiry (i.e., as more than problem-solving) is the explicit commitment to contribute to existing knowledge, even if it is not widely generalizable.

According to Mutimbi and Khaila (2011):

> A standard research methods course at university emphasizes scientific ways of conducting research. Students are taught scientific methods of collecting data, analyzing it and reporting. They collect data and analyse it in ways that enable them to describe situations as they exist, and they come up with long ‘wish lists’ in the form of recommendations for others to implement. They become experts in analyzing and developing models to describe situations – _but they cannot change the situations_. In other words, they are taught to describe problems, but not to solve them. These methods are not suitable for workers who are grappling with real life issues and are looking for ways of helping solve their problems. They need research approaches and methods that enable them to generate data that they can use to solve problems. (p. 27)
