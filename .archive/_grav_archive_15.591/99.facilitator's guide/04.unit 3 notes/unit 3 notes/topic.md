## **Unit 3 Learning Plan**

**Instructor's Notes:**

In Unit 3, the students will be discovering how to develop their professional scholarly voice, particularly through scholarly writing using APA style. This means that they will be reading and viewing content that will help them understand that there are different writing styles that are used in the world of academia and discover how important it is to use APA style in the MA Lead program.

In my face to face class, I begin discussing different styles of writing, what is APA, why we use APA, critical thinking, scholarly writing, and academic dishonesty. I spend some time emphasizing what is academic dishonesty because I have come across scenarios where student’s do not understand what plagiarism is and what the consequences are.

Next, I have the students work on an applied group activity. The students are assigned to 4 different groups. Each group will focus on one aspect of APA writing, and then the groups present the material to the rest of the class.  After each group presents, I review important details about the topic and/or correct any mistakes that were made.

The students will also get to start applying these skills in Assignment 3 (Literature Search), and then continue to practice them in assignment 4, and 5.

In my online class, students work through the unit contents, learning activities and video tutorials on their own time.

**Unit 3 is divided into the following topics:**

1. Developing Your Professional Voice
2. What is Scholarly Writing?
3. How to Write a Scholarly Paper
4. Citing the Ideas of Others

**Slides & Videos**

The power point slides are what I walk students through first. Here is a link to the [Unit 3 slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dcz-_HGNtXci_9wvzwXLnVU65HhHQMay/view?usp=sharing).

I also have students watch the following video ["The Power of Writing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfDOoADCfkg) by Dr. Jordan Peterson. In the video, Dr. Peterson explains the importance of writing.

I use the remaining slides that discuss APA style (15-100) between presentations to give examples or demonstrate an aspect that wasn’t covered, or we need to review.



**In-class Learning Activities (Formative): **

**Organize the Jigsaw Activity**

1. Assign student groups: During class time, I split the students into 4 groups to prepare a presentation on their assigned topic. I randomly assign students to groups using a [random team generator online](https://www.randomlists.com/team-generator). For this activity, students will be divided into 4 groups.

2. Assign the following topics to each group: Structure and Content, Crediting Sources, References, and Writing Clearly and Concisely.

After the groups receive their topic, the idea is that all of the students in the initial group will now become an expert on an APA topic. The students will then share this information with a teaching group so they need to have a good understanding of what the topic is and why it is important.

This Jigsaw activity will be completed in 2.5hrs. To begin, students will work in their “expert” groups for 1.5hrs and then students will reform in their “teaching” groups for 1.5 hours.

**Introduce the activity:**

Today we are going to do a classroom jigsaw. [Break students into expert groups]. You are now in your expert groups. Your task is to become experts on a section of the APA manual. Spend the time you have together refining your understanding of the assigned topic. After 1.5hrs, we will break the expert groups up and re-form into teaching groups. Teaching groups contain one member from each expert group. You are now in your teaching groups for 1.5hrs. Each of you is an expert on a different section of the APA manual. Your task now is to teach your topic to the other members of your group. You will have 15 minutes each to share this information with your group members.

**Keep track of time**

Remind students when it is time to move from their expert groups to their teaching groups.

Following the jigsaw session, we will reconvene as a class and I ask the groups if there are any unanswered questions and then I spend the remaining class time going over any clarifications or any remaining questions.

**Group 1 “Structure and Content”**

a) Watch the following video on "[Student Paper formatting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9hXY1xiZjo)". This video shows you how to set up your title page and other pages in APA style in a word document.

b) Using the guidelines in chapter 2 of the APA manual, create a title page in APA format in a word document.

c) Create a second page that uses the following APA formatting information:

- Header
- Use Times New Roman 12-point font.
- Double-space between all text lines of the paper.
- Leave 1- inch margins at the top, bottom, left, and right of every page.
- Indent the first line of every paragraph.
- Use the flush-left alignment style.
- Create three different headings.

**Group 2 “Crediting Sources”**

a) Watch the following video

b) Next, watch the following video tutorial "[In-text Citations, Quotations and Plagarism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8914hv18xnU)" by Dr. Forlenza.  In the video Dr. Forlenza discusses the importance of properly citing sources in APA format.

b) Using chapter 8 of the APA manual and the videos as your reference describe plagiarism and self-plagiarism according to the APA manual. Summarize this information and prepare a short description for the class.

c) Choose one article on servant leadership and create an example of each of the following:

- A direct quote less than 40 words with proper in-text citation.
- A direct quote more than 40 words with proper in-text citation.
- A sentence that refers to an idea from an article (paraphrased), and provide a proper in-text citation.

**Group 3 “References”**

a)  Watch the following video tutorial ["Reference Lists"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teErxDIPP5M) by Dr. Forlenza.  In the video Dr. Forlenza discusses the different elements required for, and examples of, references in APA style.

b) Using chapter 9 of the APA manual as a reference, describe the correct formatting for APA style references.

c) Find five different scholarly sources (on any topic) and provide a complete APA reference for each source. The sources you should include in your reference list are as follows

- A journal article
- A book or book chapter
- A blog post
- An online newspaper article
- A government report
- Highlight     the key formatting requirements for each of the references.

**Learning Activity 3.4: Group 4 “Writing Clearly and Concisely”**

a) Watch the following video by Dr. Hatala “[Writing Clearly and Concisely](https://youtu.be/BRu1UPPubMY)”

b) Using Chapter 4 of the APA manual as a reference discuss the APA formatting rules for the following items below and provide an example of each. I have identified the section of the APA manual that the formatting rule comes from in parentheses below.

- Continuity and flow

- Conciseness and Clarity

- Active and Passive voice

- Strategies to improve your writing

  **Required Readings:**

American Psychological Association (2019). *Publication manual of the American Psychological Association* (7th ed.)*.* **Chapters 2, 4, 8, 9**

### **Assessment**

#### Evaluating the Jigsaw Activity

Part of your responsibility as the facilitator will be to evaluate student participation in the jigsaw activity. You can do this by keeping a student list with you in each class and then providing a score for each student at the end of the class based on the rubric provided below.

| **CATEGORY**            | **Mastering**                                                | **Developing**                                               | **Emerging**                                                 | **Not Meeting**                                              |
