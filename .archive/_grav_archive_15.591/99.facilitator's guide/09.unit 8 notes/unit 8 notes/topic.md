## Unit 8 Learning Plan

**Instructor's Notes:**

In Unit 8, the student will get a chance to explore Action Research. Action research may employ virtually any research methodology and will commonly be conducted collaboratively with other professionals. Action research differs from more formal research in some important ways that you will uncover in the readings and learning activities this week.

The learning activities in this unit are a little different. Specifically, the class will be pre-assembled into groups and they will collaboratively create an idea for an action research project based on one of the practical problems they have identified in their personal or professional life. The group will present this project idea for their colleagues in a creative format.

Then the audience will practice evaluating action research projects process as a form of peer review.

In the online class, students work individually on project ideas and record a presentation in a podcast.  The students then post a link for their podcast in the unit discussion forum and students are partnered with peers to conduct a peer-review of the action research idea.

Unit 8 is divided into the following topics:

1. What is Action Research?
2. The Action Research Method
3. Evaluating An Action Research Study

**Slides and Video Links**

I present slides 1-12 in the first part of the class.  Here is a link to the [Unit 8 slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GQFqqNMVtzLWnVqfdixTmYz82yfXgKqW/view?usp=sharing).

Next, we watch video by John Spencer (2017) that explains what action research is [**http://www.spencerauthor.com/how-action-research-sparks-innovation-and-boosts-creativity-in-the-classroom/**](http://www.spencerauthor.com/how-action-research-sparks-innovation-and-boosts-creativity-in-the-classroom/)

Then we watch a video of an actual action research project to provide an example of what their presentation could look like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w97eQn5AyKc

**In-Class Learning Activities (Formative):**

During class time, I organize the students into 4 groups so that they can collaborate on developing an action research project.

**Learning Activity 8.1: Create and Present**

In this learning activity you will develop your own “action research” project as a group. To begin, you will share ideas of a "problem" you are currently experiencing in your professional context. Then you will choose one idea to develop an “action research” project. Next, design your project by following steps 1-11 below. Once your project is complete you will be asked to present the project to the rest of the class for “peer review”. Be as creative as you would like!

**Action Research Steps:**

Step 1: Decide what enterprise, program or project you want to investigate.

Step 2: Provide a brief background

Step 3: State the problem

Step 4: State your specific objectives: *If I do (action), how or what effect will it have on (outcome).*

Step 5: Identify the key recommendations for successfully dealing with the “problem”

Step 6: Construct a questionnaire/check list/measure/survey to assess XXX

Step 7: Administer the test and mark the test

Step 8: Analyze the results

Step 9: Identify opportunities for improvement

Step 10: Implement the plan

Step 11: Reflect and evaluate

Step 12: Present your project to the class (be creative!)

Next, you will peer review projects presented by colleagues in the class.

Make notes about the strengths of the project idea as well as areas to work on (clarify, more analysis, more personal application) by using the evaluation criteria for an action research study outlined by Plano-Clark and Creswell on page 444-445. Here are questions you should address in your evaluation:

1. Does the project focus on a real problem in practice?
2. Does the researcher plan to study his or her own practices or plan to collaborate with community     members?
3. Does the project include careful reflection about the problem?
4. Does the researcher plan to gather several sources of information (e.g., qualitative and quantitative     procedures)?
5. Does the researcher develop a clear plan for addressing the problem?
6. Does the project include reflecting, thinking, looking, and gathering information and acting?
7. Will the results of the project enhance the lives of those involved?
