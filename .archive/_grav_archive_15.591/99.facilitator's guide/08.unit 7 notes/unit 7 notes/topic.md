## Unit 7 Learning Plan

**Instructor's Notes:**

In unit 7 we will investigate mixed methods research design. Mixed methods is the conscious inclusion of both qualitative and quantitative methods and so doing, seeks to mitigate some of the inherent tensions and weaknesses in both. The students will practice the evaluation process in their learning activities this week.

In my online class, students work through the unit contents, learning activities on their own time.

Unit 7 is divided into the following topics:

1. Introduction to Mixed-Methods Research
2. Mixed-Methods Research Designs
3. Using Mixed-Methods to Understand Leadership.

**Slides and video links:**

I begin by presenting slides 1-6.  Then we watch the video “[Telling a Complete Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5e7kVzMIfs)” by John Creswell. Next, I have students complete a learning activity described on slide 7 and 8. Then I finish presenting slides 9-16.

**In-class Learning Activities (formative):**

**Learning Activity 7.1: Partner Activity**

Interview Activity Instructions:

In pairs, you will be given the task of interviewing a partner about transformational servant leadership. During your interview, you will ask them a series of questions.

1. Start by asking your partner to complete the Servant Leadership Questionnaire found here: http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/leader/servant_leadership_survey.html
2. Then ask them to answer the following questions out loud while you take notes:

·     What was your score on the servant leadership questionnaire?

·     Do you think this score accurately represents your own servant leadership characteristics?

·     Describe an example of a TSL leader in your life.

·     What values and characteristics define that person?

·     What does Transformational Servant Leadership (TSL) mean to you?

You will have 30 minutes each to answer these questions. Record your results on the Mixed Methods forum provide in the unit 7 tab.

**Learning Activity 7.2: Read, Evaluate, Present**

During class time, I organize the students into 4 groups so that they can evaluate the methods and results section of a mixed methods research article (see articles listed below). I have built these learning activities into the slide presentation so that you know when I include them during the class.

Articles for the learning activity:

As a group, read the methods and results section of an article from the Unit 7 resources to focus on to answer the questions in this learning activity.

Using the evaluation criteria on pg. 405 in Plano-Clark & Creswell (2015), complete the following questions to evaluate the use of the mixed methods approach in the servant leadership article you chose. The figure on page 406 provides a template for recording your rating and rationale. Make sure that you include your article reference, quality rating (0-21) and also the rationale/evidence for your rating in your response.

Prepare a short presentation summarizing your evaluation to the class.
