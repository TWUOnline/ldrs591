### Unit 10 Summary

We have come to the conclusion of our course together. In this unit, you had the opportunity to revisit a question about making informed decisions, discuss why evidence-based decision making is important for the Transformational Servant Leader, and reflect on your own expectations for a high quality research report.

It has been a pleasure to teach all of you. I look forward to hearing about your journey ahead as you progress throughout the MA Lead Program.

Best Wishes,

Dr. Strong
