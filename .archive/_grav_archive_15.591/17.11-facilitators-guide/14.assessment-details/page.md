### In Class Participation and Engagement

Active participation in group exercises, reflections, and critical discourse is an essential component of this course. Students are expected to show respect for all members of the course, both in speech and actions. They are to contribute by actively observing and listening, raising thoughtful questions, examining relevant issues, building on others’ ideas, analyzing and evaluating the group’s thinking, synthesizing key points, and expanding the group’s perspectives. Please see the syllabus and Moodle for more details and the grading rubric and as facilitator your feedback in this area is invaluable.

#### Evaluating Group Discussions

Part of your responsibility as the facilitator will be to evaluate student participation in group discussions. You can do this by keeping a student list with you in each class and then providing a score for each student at the end of the class based on the rubric provided below.

## **On-line Class Participation and Engagement** 

As you work through the material in this course, you will be asked to respond to questions every week on the unit discussion forums. The objective of this assignment is to provide you with the opportunity to organize and consolidate your learning, that is, to review and make sense of your experiences over the course. This assignment involves reflection on issues such as: your change and growth as a consumer of research, important experiences that you had, and your current thoughts about evidence-based decision making. Please see the course website for details and the grading rubric.

### **Assignment 1: Clarifying Your Research Interest**

In this assignment, you are asked to develop a concept map depicting your interests (personal and/or professional) and use the concept map to generate research questions amenable to scholarly inquiry. A concept map is a general method used by individuals or groups to describe ideas in the form of a picture (Trochim, 2001). The picture can then be used to articulate or refine research areas relevant to scientists and stakeholders. Details of this assignment will be provided on the course website in addition to the grading rubric.

### **Assignment 2: Literature Review Search**

The objective of this assignment is to help you to locate and organize the literature sources necessary to write a graduate-level literature review demonstrating critical thinking and analytical skills. This assignment is closely related to the Final Literature Review assignment. In this assignment you will demonstrate your scholarly inquiry learning by locating and organizing the literature base that you will use in writing a graduate-level literature review. Please see the course website for details and the grading rubric.

### Assignment 3: Scholarly Article Critique

In this assignment you will be reviewing and critiquing elements of an article of your choice. This assignment is the next step in moving toward a literature review paper. This assignment requires you to synthesize a lot of information in a concise way, which can be challenging at first. Writing drafts of each section and then editing these to consolidate information is recommended. Please see the course website for more detailed information and the grading rubric. 

### Assignment 4: Final Literature Review

In this assignment you will demonstrate your scholarly inquiry learning by writing a graduate-level literature review. This literature review will represent your analysis and synthesis of the literature located and organized in the Literature Review Search assignment. Please see the course website for details and the grading rubric.
