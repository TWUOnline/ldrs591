## Unit 2: Accessing and Evaluating Scholarly Literature

### Overview

In Unit 2, we will focus on gaining familiarity with various genres of scholarly literature, getting a sense of how these genres contribute to your own scholarly endeavours. Through first-hand experience you will begin locating, organizing and evaluating relevant scholarly literature. Two of the major assignments in this course hinge on your ability to conduct a review of precedent literature. Although these assignments are not due until the later in this course, our work in Unit 2 is the foundation for those assignments.  

### Topics

Unit 2 is divided into 3 topics:

1. Accessing Scholarly Literature

2. Utilizing Scholarly Literature

3. Evaluating scholarly literature



### Learning Outcomes
