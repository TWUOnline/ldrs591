### Unit 7 Summary

In general researchers conduct mixed methods studies when both quantitative and qualitative data together provide a better understanding of the research problem. The use of mixed method research provides a number of advantages, namely:

*   Provides strengths that offset the weaknesses of both quantitative and qualitative research.
*   Provides a more complete and comprehensive understanding of the research problem than either quantitative or qualitative approaches alone.
*   Provides an approach for developing better, more context specific instruments.
*   Helps to explain findings or how causal processes work.
