:fa-book: Next, read the article by Beck (2014). [Antecedents of servant leadership: A mixed methods study](https://doi.org/10.1177/1548051814529993) to prepare yourself for the group activity in this unit.  

:fa-pencil: Next, practice evaluating the mixed-methods approach, using the Beck article. Use the quality criteria discussed in Table 12.2 (Plano-Clark & Creswell, 2015) to evaluate the quality of a mixed-methods research report. 

:fa-pencil: Finally, in your learning journal, identify what your overall quality rating is of this section and list three pieces of evidence to support your rating. Make some notes about what you would look for in a high quality mixed-methods research report.

*Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit.*
