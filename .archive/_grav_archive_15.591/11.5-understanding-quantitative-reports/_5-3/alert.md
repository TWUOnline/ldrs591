:fa-book: Next,  read chapter 7, "Participants and Data Collection," in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015).

**:fa-pencil: Practice evaluating the quality of a quantitative studyâ€™s participants and data collection, using the Van Dierendonck et al., article.**

Use the quality criteria discussed in Table 7.2 (Plano-Clark & Creswell, 2015) to evaluate the quality of the participants and data collection. 

:fa-pencil: Finally, in your learning journal, identify what your overall quality rating is of this section and list three pieces of evidence to support your rating. Make some notes about what you would look for in a high quality "Participants and Data Collection" section of a quantitative research report.

*Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit.*
