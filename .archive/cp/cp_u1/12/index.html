<div class="reflect">
<p>The Master of Arts in Leadership program values the application of best practices to your personal and professional practice. Before we get into some of the concrete realities of accessing scholarly literature, we would like you to take time to reflect on and articulate some of the salient <strong>leadership interests</strong> in your personal and professional life and practice. At the end of the MA Leadership program (in LDRS 697 &amp; 698) you will get an opportunity to create a project based on a salient leadership problem/interest. It is good to start thinking about what the topic may be now so that you can use the assignments in this course to start preparing for your final project.</p>
<p>üì∫ Begin this learning activity by watching the following video about asking significant questions:</p>

<p>‚úèÔ∏è Take time to answer the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Where do you see the greatest need for change in the field you want to work as a leader?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What would you propose to change in your field and why?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Try using the following three statements to help you get some clarity about what exactly you want to investigate. If you can fill out these statements, then you most likely have a narrow enough topic with enough direction to perform some great research.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am researching <strong>____________</strong> (What? Topic) because I want to find out <strong>________</strong> (So What? Issue/question) in order to <strong>________</strong> (Now What? Application/Purpose).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit.</em></p>
