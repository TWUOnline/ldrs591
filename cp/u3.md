# Overview {#header}

An essential attribute of scholarly work is that of writing well.
Writing well involves several components. Some are
conceptual---reasoning and developing a logical argument. Others reflect
the mechanics of good written communication---organization of a
manuscript, style and language use, grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
APA formatting also falls within this category of the mechanics of
writing well. The MA Leadership program uses the APA Manual (7th
edition) as the model for formatting written work formally submitted.
Unit 3 is devoted to helping you become familiar with some of the more
common elements of scholarly writing and APA style.

# Developing Your Scholarly Voice {#header}

In Unit 3 you will be discovering how to develop your professional
scholarly voice, specifically through your scholarly writing. This means
that you will be reading content that will help you understand that
there are different writing styles that are used in the world of
academia and how important it is to use APA style in the MA Lead
program.

Your learning activities this week are focused on applying the APA
standards for general aspects of writing, mechanics of writing and
citing sources. You will also have a chance to apply these skills in
literature search, scholarly article critique, and formal literature
review. Let's get started!

When you are asked to write a scholarly paper in graduate school, what
you are really being asked to do is to develop your professional voice
(McDonald, 2011). A professional voice can be described as utilizing
formal language, good vocabulary and appropriate tone in your written
and oral communication (Walden University Writing Center, 2017).
Characteristics of a strong professional voice are writing concisely,
with clarity and precision, and appropriately citing your sources
(McDonald, 2011).

Developing your professional voice is important because some students
will turn their papers into professional manuscripts that will be
submitted to a journal or a book. Some students may be asked to present
their work at a professional conference. McDonald suggests that "for
most students, writing papers in graduate school is an exercise in
presenting important information in an easy to understand and concise
way" (p.125).

A well developed professional voice can also benefit you in your
professional context. For example, at work you may be asked to write a
briefing document for your school or hospital board, or you may be asked
to share your ideas with other professionals at a conference, or you may
be asked to write a grant to fund your organization\'s new project.
These are just three examples of professional situations where it is
important to have a well-developed professional voice so that you can
communicate in a clear and concise way.

In order to communicate well, you need to have a system to organize your
thoughts so that the information you are writing is presented in an
organized and clear manner. There are a wide variety of publication
styles that are employed today in universities and in scholarly
publications. A few that you may be familiar with are Chicago style, MLA
style, Turbian style and APA style. The American Psychological
Association (APA) has developed a writing style that is used to
establish a standard of written communication. This standard includes:
the organization of content, writing style or writing mechanics, citing
references, and how to prepare a manuscript for publication in certain
disciplines (APA, 2010). The MA Leadership program uses the APA Manual
(7th edition) as the model for formatting written work formally
submitted.

Aside from simplifying the work of your instructors by having everyone
use the same format for a given paper, using APA style makes it easier
for readers to understand a text by providing a familiar structure they
can follow. Abiding by APA's standards as a writer will allow you to:

1.  Provide readers with cues they can use to follow your ideas more
    efficiently.
2.  Provide readers with dates of publications to help them locate
    current information that may be of interest to them.
3.  Allow readers to focus more on your ideas by not distracting them
    with unfamiliar formatting.
4.  Establish your credibility in the field by demonstrating an
    awareness of your audience and their needs as fellow researchers.

# What is Scholarly Writing? {#header}

According to Heady (2013), graduate-level (or scholarly) writing is
"clear, correct and concise, but it adds the elements of originality and
discipline specific expertise" (p.¬†2). Heady suggests that
graduate-level writing explores a topic or a research question in an
original way, demonstrates extensive research done on the topic, has a
strong organizational structure, and is written for a professional
audience. The scholarly writer writes in a way that is skillful,
engaging and organized well so that the paper moves from point to point
allowing the reader to follow in a logical progression. Heady also
states that "a good paper has a clear and obvious structure: you can
enter it through a clear, well-composed introduction, you move from
section to section, and you exit where you know you have been and what
you have seen" (p.¬†73).

::: {#critical-thinking .section .level4 .unnumbered .hasAnchor}
#### Critical Thinking[](https://learn.twu.ca/developing-your-professional-voice.html#critical-thinking){.anchor-section aria-label="Anchor link to header"}

One of the distinguishing features of scholarly writing is the practice
of critical thinking. Critical thinking is "that mode of thinking ---
about any subject, content, or problem --- in which the thinker improves
the quality of his or her thinking by skillfully analyzing, assessing
and reconstructing it" (Foundation for Critical Thinking, 2015). In
addition, critical thinking also involves creating new and original
information, conclusions and ideas (Heady, 2013). Scholarly writing,
should reflect higher levels of learning. According to Bloom's (1956)
taxonomy there are six levels of learning: knowledge, comprehension,
application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation. When you are writing a
scholarly paper, the focus should not be on just identifying,
comprehending material and applying it, your writing should also reflect
analysis, synthesis and evaluation. What this means is that your writing
(and your thinking) should be able to: \* Break down ideas into parts
and see how those parts relate and are organized to demonstrate
analysis. \* Re-arrange ideas into a new whole to demonstrate synthesis.
\* Make judgments based on internal evidence or external criteria to
demonstrate evaluation.
:::

::: {#structure-and-organization .section .level4 .unnumbered .hasAnchor}
#### Structure and Organization[](https://learn.twu.ca/developing-your-professional-voice.html#structure-and-organization){.anchor-section aria-label="Anchor link to header"}

Writing a scholarly paper often follows a very distinct organizational
structure and includes: a title page, an introduction, methods and
results, a discussion and a list of references. Let's take a closer look
at what should be included in each of these sections of a scholarly
paper.

**Title Page:** This is the first page of your paper and it should
include a title that summarizes the main topic you will be discussing.
It should also include your name (the author), and the institution you
are affiliated with (Trinity Western University). It is also helpful if
you include the date that you are submitting the assignment.

**Abstract:** This the second page of your paper. The purpose of the
abstract is for the author to convey the sentiment of the study in a
concise yet informative manner. The abstract is used to determine if the
reader is interested in the article and wants to retrieve the article
for further information. In 250 words, the abstract explicitly states
the overall problem and research question, a brief description of the
method, a summary of the findings and important conclusions.

**Introduction:** The purpose of an introduction is to inform the reader
of the rationale for your research topic. It should provide a brief
overview of the "problem" that you are addressing by providing a broad
context, any relevant statistics and describing the importance of your
topic. The introduction is also the place where you can define any
important terms that may be unfamiliar to the reader and ends with
establishing what the key purpose for the paper is. The purpose can be
stated as your research question.

**Methods:** The methods section outlines specifically what procedures
the author chose to do. In a research report this section will include
the sampling methods, sample size, measures, research design, and
interventions used. The methods section of a research report looks very
different than a methods section of a literature review. In a literature
review, the methods section will emphasize how you chose the articles
and how you evaluated the articles you reviewed. This will include
describing any inclusion or exclusion criteria, the databases that were
searched, what key search terms were used, how many records were
obtained and how many articles were included in the review. You can
refer to the APA (2019) manual for a more detailed explanation of the
methods section.

**Results:** The results section reports the findings of the data
analysis of a research report or the critical analysis of a literature
review. Please refer to the APA manual (2019) for extensive detail about
the results of different empirical research reports.

**Discussion:** In the discussion section, the authors describe their
own interpretations of the results and link these interpretations back
to the literature that was reviewed. In this section the author may
discuss the strengths and limitations of the literature, draw
conclusions, and make recommendations for future research on the topic.

**Reference List:** The reference list provides a precise list of all of
the sources you cited within your paper.

# How to Write a Scholarly Paper {#header}

To begin writing a scholarly paper you need to have a research topic in
mind. Then you need to do a review of scholarly literature to obtain a
good working knowledge of your topic and then critically evaluate and
synthesize the literature you have read. Finally, you need to have an
organizational system for presenting what you know about the research
topic. The APA (2019) manual provides a clear organizational structure
for presenting scholarly information.

When you begin writing, it is important to remember that you are
communicating ideas about a topic to a specific audience. In order to
convey your ideas well, you need to write clearly and concisely with set
of specific guidelines. This is important for two reasons: to keep your
reader's attention and to make sure your meaning is clear. If your
writing is long-winded, you will either lose the interest of your reader
or confuse your reader. When your writing is more concise and clear,
this will motivate your reader to pay attention to what you have to say.

There are also times when you are writing with a specific purpose in
mind. For example, to prepare an assignment or a board briefing
document. Writing clearly and concisely helps a writer communicate what
needs to be said in an efficient and effective way. It is also easy to
understand and helps the writer connect with the audience. Here is an
excellent resource by the Purdue Owl Writing Center on \"Tips for
Writing in North American Colleges\"(owl.purdue.edu ‚Ä∫ owl ‚Ä∫
tips_for_writing_in_north_american_colleges). This website is full of
helpful resources to help you improve your scholarly writing.

# Citing the Ideas of Others {#header}

Within each section of a scholarly paper, each paragraph utilizes a
combination three types of content: claims, evidence and transitions.
Heady states that "claims are the points you want to prove,
interpretations you want to offer, and assertions you want to make,
whereas, evidence is the material you use to back up your claims"
(pp.¬†74-75). Some examples of types of evidence that may be used to
support claims include: "quotes from a book, citations from an article,
data from a study, personal experience, historical facts, statistics,
etc. Transitions are one or two words that help you move from one claim
to another" (pp.¬†74-75).

An example of the three types of content (claims, evidence and
transitions) included in a paragraph of scholarly writing is provided
below from the article "A Systematic Literature Review of Servant
Leadership Theory in Organizational Contexts" by Parris and Peachy
(2013, pp.¬†377-378):

> Over the years, some leadership scholars have called attention to the
> implicit connection between ethics and leadership. A burgeoning new
> research area and leadership theory that has been linked to ethics,
> virtues and morality is servant leadership (Graham 1991; Lancot and
> Irving 2010; Parolini et al.¬†2009; Russell 2001; Whetstone, 2002).
> Despite servant leadership being coined by Robert K. Greenleaf over
> three decades ago in 1970, it remains understudied yet prominently
> practiced in boardrooms and organizations (Bass and Bass 2008; Spears
> 2005).

From the example above, you can see that a topic is introduced in the
first sentence. A claim with supporting evidence is provided in the
second sentence (with references) and the transition begins in the third
sentence with the word "despite". The third sentence also includes a
claim with supporting evidence (references). This paragraph structure is
typical of what you would find in scholarly writing. Scholarly writing
involves putting your own thoughts and ideas (claims) in context by
ensuring that you are citing the ideas of those who have influenced you
(APA, 2010, p.169).

Heady (2013) suggests five general rules you should always follow when
you are organizing your paper (p.¬†80):

1.  You must provide enough background information to give your reader a
    good working knowledge of your topic.
2.  Your background information must lead logically to your research
    question.
3.  All claims/ideas/facts must be backed up by evidence.
4.  All evidence must be related to a claim/idea/fact.
5.  If evidence does not back up a claim, you need to explain why and/or
    account for it.

The reference list provides a precise list of all of the sources you
cited within your paper. APA (7th edition) has many rules to follow for
correct formatting of references (see chapters 6 and 7). In general, the
APA manual states "when in doubt, provide more information rather than
less. Because one purpose of listing references is to enable readers to
retrieve and use the sources..." (p.193).

I just want to encourage you because you have worked through a lot of
very technical material in this unit. I want you to know that I expect
students to make many APA mistakes in this course. I don't expect
everyone to read the APA manual, watch the tutorial videos, and be able
to apply every detail automatically. What I do expect is that you try to
begin applying what you have learned about APA every time you write
something. You will find with every assignment that you will make APA
mistakes, and that is ok. I actually find the best way to learn APA is
to make mistakes, correct them, and then learn what to do right the next
time. I still make mistakes and I have been working with APA style for
many years.
