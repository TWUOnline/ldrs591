# What is Scholarly Inquiry? {#header}

Inquiry is "the process of developing skills to arrive at understandings
of a problem, an issue, or a phenomenon, through the process of asking
good questions, searching out good evidence, and arriving at
well-reasoned conclusions" (Penner, 2017).

By now you are well aware of the applied nature of the MA in Leadership
program. This feature may be an important part of what attracted you to
the program! Why then study research methods? Why worry about scholarly
inquiry? This course in scholarly inquiry will help you to develop
systematic thinking skills applicable in all realms of leadership and
everyday life. As Rosch, Kniffin, and Guthrie (2023) note, research
focuses our professional knowledge, to inform your leader-centric,
group-centric, and context-centric to guide the broader view of our
leadership position and contributes to our ocverall leadership  practice
(p. 23). Moreover, our leadership practice is ideally evidence-based;
that is, based on evidence derived from systematic scholarly inquiry.


# Learning Activity {#header}

According to Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015), "research is a process of
steps used to collect and analyze information in order to increase our
knowledge about a topic or an issue" (p.4) and it is different then
informal research.

See below for more information on keeping a Reflective Learning Journal.


# Introduction to the Reflective Journal {#header}

A reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. There is no
correct way to create this journal; rather, it is a reflection of the
way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning.
Journals can consist of traditional note taking on paper, or in a word
document, you can create mind maps, pictures, or just write
stream-of-consciousness, you can record your thoughts in an audio file,
write down important quotes, create sketches, or drawings: whatever you
choose to include. Experiment and have fun.

The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your
learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout
the course's readings, activities, and discussions with your instructor
and your fellow students. Reflecting upon these learning events will
help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help
integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and
work.

Throughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as
we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist
you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order
to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an
activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even
outside of our scheduled course activities.


# Common Questions Used for Reflective Journaling {#header}

::: caution
-   In your view, what were the most important points in the readings,
    videoclips, or discussions with your fellow students and tutors?
-   What information did you already know?
-   What new knowledge, ideas, or perspectives have you gained?
-   What information was easy to remember or learn? Why?
-   What concepts did you find more difficult? Why?
-   How can you apply this knowledge to your work or current experience?
-   How has this knowledge helped you to make sense of your current or
    previous experience?
-   Has your understanding of a personal or work-related situation
    changed after studying these concepts?
-   Did you agree or disagree with any of the material? If yes, how did
    you react and why?
-   If you could have the opportunity to engage in further learning,
    what would it be?
-   What further questions would like to ask the author of your
    readings?
-   What other articles, books or discussions would be of interest?

# Leadership and Scholarly Inquiry {#header}

On what basis are sound decisions made? What evidence do leaders rely
upon for best outcomes? The need to evaluate evidence for best practices
in leadership decision-making is widely acknowledged. Patton (2001)
observes that "the emphasis on knowledge generation disseminated in the
form of best practices has swept like wildfire through all sectors of
society" (p. 329).

We often refer to the vision of best practices in leadership within the
MA in Leadership program. What do we mean by this? Put simply, "best
practices" refers to those practices and initiatives that result in the
best possible outcomes. How do we know what best practice is? The
process of identifying best practices begins with an understanding of
common sources of evidence available to leaders.

Take a moment to think about a recent decision you made as a leader. On
what did you base this decision? Previous experience? Values? Company
policy? Empirical evidence (e.g., data derived from research)? Expert
opinion? Systematic inquiry (as represented by research) is one tool
that leaders can use to inform best practices and their decision making
process.

Systematic inquiry is hardly new -- in first century writings we see in
the Bible evidence of systematic, logical, and empirical inquiry.
Consider the following passage from Luke, a physician trained in
empirical methods of his day:

> Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have
> been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those
> who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. With
> this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything
> from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you,
> most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the
> things you have been taught. (Luke 1:1-4, NIV)

How does the research process differ from managerial activities such as
decision-making and problem solving? Research shares with
decision-making and problem-solving the systematic and disciplined
procedure of identifying an issue/problem, deciding on an approach,
formulating a plan, collecting and analyzing data, drawing conclusions
and implementing decisions based on this rigorous process. What
distinguishes research from generic or everyday problem solving is its
commitment to advance or generate knowledge that typically will be
communicated to the larger academic or scientific community. The past
two decades have produced remarkable growth in the area of foundations
of research and research methodologies within natural, applied, and
social sciences and humanities.

::: {#boyers-model-of-scholarship .section .level3 .unnumbered .hasAnchor}
### Boyer's Model of Scholarship[](https://learn.twu.ca/introduction-to-scholarly-inquiry.html#boyers-model-of-scholarship){.anchor-section aria-label="Anchor link to header"}

The Master of Arts in Leadership program is focused on applied
scholarship. In defining this, Boyer's four-part Model of Scholarship
(1997) is useful. Boyer's typology identifies four domains of
scholarship: **discovery**, **integration**, **application**, and
**teaching**. The model is discussed by Marta Nibert (2011) in her paper
titled *Boyer's Model of Scholarship*. In the section titled
**Application** she notes that the scholarship of

> . . . application, focuses on using research findings and innovations
> to remedy societal problems. Included in this category are service
> activities that are specifically tied to one's field of knowledge and
> professional activities. Beneficiaries of these activities include
> commercial entities, non-profit organizations, and professional
> associations*.* (para. 4)

Though Nibert's primary audience is the professoriate, this material is
relevant for MA in Leadership learners. Application is highlighted
because the Master of Arts in Leadership was designed to focus primarily
on the scholarship of application, although work in the capstone will
likely include one or more of the other domains.

Boyer's *Scholarship of Discovery* is the type of scholarship associated
with traditional scholarly research. "Research is a systematic process
of collecting, analyzing and interpreting information (data) in order to
increase our understanding of a phenomenon abut which we are interested
or concerned" (Leedy & Ormrod 2010, p. 2).

Boyer's Scholarship of Discovery is often referred to as *primary
research*. Primary research is narrowly focused, and contributes to the
body of knowledge by helping us to understand one isolated part of
reality in detail in the hopes that this understanding can be
generalized to some degree to a broader part of reality. The Scholarship
of Discovery (in traditional research) falls into two distinct genres:
quantitative research and qualitative research. Each of these genres
manifest in numerous variations, including hybrid models involving both
quantitative and qualitative elements, designed for and suited to
differing research questions.

Boyer's *Scholarship of Integration* is "the attempt to arrange relevant
bits of knowledge and insight from different disciplines into broader
patterns that reflect the actual interconnectedness of the world" (Boyer
cited in Jacobsen & Jacobsen, 2004, p. 51). Scholarship of Integration
often demands interdisciplinary collaboration and requires that the
critical analysis and review of knowledge be followed by the creative
synthesis of views and insights in such a way that what is known speaks
to specific topics or issues.

The *Scholarship of Application* is "the scholarship of engagement;
seeking to close the gap between values in the academy and the needs of
the larger world" (Boyer cited in Jacobsen & Jacobsen, 2004, p. 51). In
the Scholarship of Application, knowledge is applied to the solution of
societal needs and practice. In most cases, knowledge stemming from the
Scholarship of Discovery and the Scholarship of Integration informs the
solutions to particular problems. The Scholarships of Discovery and
Integration are often associated with the context of formal education.
The Scholarship of Application may happen within formal education
contexts, it is most often associated with other settings (Bosher 2009,
p. 6).

Finally, the *Scholarship of Teaching* is "the scholarship of sharing
knowledge" (Boyer cited in Jacobsen & Jacobsen, 2004, p. 51). The
Scholarship of Teaching involves the reflective analysis of the
knowledge about teaching and learning. This knowledge base itself is the
product of the Scholarships of Discovery, Integration and Application
combining as "active ingredients of a dynamic and iterative teaching
process" (Bosher, 2009, p. 5).

Boyer's typology originally identified as the Scholarship of Teaching
has been expanded somewhat and is widely known today in the literature
as the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (Bosher, 2009). You have
undoubtedly already noticed an ambiguity: If the entire model is called
the Scholarship of Teaching, how is it that the last element depicted in
the chart above is also called the Scholarship of Teaching? This
ambiguity is evident, Bosher contends that Boyer's four domains were
conceived holistically as elements that overlap and interact, not as
discrete elements, appearing in any predictable order, and are better
viewed as an operating system than a list of discrete elements (2009,
pp. 4-5).

# Philosophical Foundations of Research {#header}

A professor of mine often observed that a fundamental attribute of being
human is to ask questions. Humanity is especially interested in three
fundamental questions: What is real? What is true? What is good? The
philosophical category of metaphysics is concerned with what is real,
and what is the nature of reality. The philosophical category of
epistemology is concerned with what is true, and what is the nature and
process of knowing. The philosophical category of axiology is concerned
with what is good and how we can determine the nature of goodness. Much
of history is a chronicle of the different ways people have answered
these three fundamental questions. How we answer these questions reveals
our perspective, or our worldview.

Every person bases his or her own thoughts, decisions, and actions on
what is called a worldview. A worldview is "an interpretive framework
through which one makes sense of themselves, other people, and the world
around them" (Geisler & Watkins, 2003). It is like a pair of glasses
that you wear when you are observing things about yourself, other people
and the world in which you live. Here is a short video by the Impact 360
Institute (2014) that explains "What's your worldview?"

::: video
:::

A discussion about worldview, or your perspective, is foundational to
what we want to accomplish in this course. Throughout this course I will
ask these questions: On what basis are sound decisions made? What
evidence do leaders rely upon for best outcomes when they are making
decisions? Each of us has a preference for obtaining truth or a
framework for understanding ourselves, others, and the world, and
personal preferences abound. Researchers and consumers of research
(i.e. us) approach knowledge and learning and life with a certain
perspective and it is important to understand that perspective before
you jump into the research journey and it is certainly something to
consider in positions of leadership.

Here is a really helpful video by Laura Killam (2013) that explains
Paradigms, Ontology and Epistemology.

::: video
:::

It is important to be aware of your worldview before you enter into the
research journey because it will inform the types of questions that you
ask as well as the processes that you use to find the answers to your
questions. As an example, let me explain a Christian worldview and
explore how this worldview can be applied to the research journey.

A Christian worldview asserts that God has created the world and
everything in it, and that truth is arrived at through a study of God's
specific revelation (the Bible) and general revelation (creation).
Christians believe not only in studying and understanding truth, but
they also believe in a personal God that has revealed Himself through
this created world.

The Christian worldview can be summarized in three words: Creation, Fall
and Redemption. Let me unpack these terms. Initially, when God created
the world, it was all good and whole and harmonious. God created man in
His own image. Originally man was created healthy in body, soul and
spirit (Genesis 1:26-27, 31). As people rebelled against God, causing
the Fall, the presence of sin corrupted all aspects of God's good
creation, and brought about much suffering. Where there was formerly
harmony and wholeness, we now experience ourselves, our relationships
and the world around us as fractured, broken and full of dis-ease (a
literal discomfort with who we are) (Genesis 3).

Despite the brokenness, Christians believe that God is actively working
to bring about restoration and wholeness to His entire creation. Through
Christ's redemptive work on the cross, people are reconciled to God and
are challenged to make all things as they were created and meant to be
-- very good. Redemption means that all things are made new in Christ
(Colossians 1:19-20).

The framework of Creation, Fall and Redemption is important because it
allows us to enter into a discussion about research with confidence
knowing that God's redemptive work touches this area. Christians believe
that we are called to study creation with the desire to take the
knowledge we gain and use it to help and bless others; to work toward
the restoration and healing of God's creation. Christians are called to
inquire, to investigate, to ask questions, always with a view to serve
others.

It is beyond the purpose of this course to go deeper into this topic
other than to make the point that our way of knowing and understanding
the world around us (i.e., our worldview) influences how we approach all
of life, including how we approach research and how we use research to
inform our decision-making process.


# The Research Process {#header}

Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) define research as "a process of steps
used to collect and analyze information in order to increase our
knowledge about a topic or issue" (p. 4). Plano-Clark and Creswell
(2015) identify eight steps in the research process which provide us
with a useful framework that describes what researchers do when they
conduct their studies. These steps help us understand the information
that is included in their reports. Listed below are each of the eight
steps in the research process.

1.  The whole process begins with **identifying the research problem**.
    This step is vitally important. The statement of the research
    problem is the very foundation that subsequent research is built
    upon, and quite literally guides each and every step moving forward.
2.  A **literature review** is a summary of the "state of knowledge" in
    a given area. This step is the primary focus of this course and
    involves locating relevant scholarly literature, and analyzing,
    synthesizing and summarizing what precedent literature has to say
    about a specific topic.
3.  The **purpose of research** includes identifying the objective of a
    study (e.g., purpose statement). This information is typically
    expressed in a few research questions or hypotheses.
4.  Next, it is important to **choose a research design.** This step
    involves describing an overall plan or approach of the study and
    also explains the methods used to carry out the plan.
5.  **Selecting participants and collecting data** includes who will be
    the participants, how you will collect information from those
    participants, and what permission you need to obtain in order to
    collect the information.
6.  **Analyzing data** involves systematic processes to make sense of
    the information that has been gathered. We call this process
    "results," which are then reported in forms appropriate to the
    research method (e.g., statistics or words).
7.  **Drawing conclusions** means interpreting the results and
    explaining how the conclusions relate to the research
    questions/hypotheses, and/or similar studies. There is also a
    discussion of limitations of the study and often suggestions of
    implications for the intended audiences, for practice and for future
    research.
8.  **Disseminating and evaluating the research.** Usually the term
    "disseminated" means "published." The most common way that research
    is disseminated is in journals dedicated to publishing primary
    research.

# Asking Significant Questions {#header}

The most important part of the research process is beginning with a good
research question. This is something that will be highly relevant to
completing of most of your assignments in this course.

The research process often starts when you ask a question about
something that you observe: How, What, When, Who, Which, Why, or Where?
Questions can be based on what you observe in the real world, or on
intuition or a "gut feeling".

The question that you select is the cornerstone of your work in this
course. The assignments you will be working on will revolve around
finding an answer to the question you are posing. It is important to
select a question that is going to be interesting to work on for the
length of this course and a question that is specific enough to allow
you to find the answer.

The Higher Education Academy and Sheffield Hallam University (2005) have
developed an excellent guide for [Formulating the Research
Question.](http://www.socscidiss.bham.ac.uk/research-question.html){target="_blank"}
According to the authors, good questions are:

***Relevant*:** The question will be of interest to people in your field
and arise from issues raised in the literature or in practice. You
should be able to establish a clear purpose for your research in
relation to the chosen field. For example, are you filling a gap in
knowledge, analyzing professional practice, monitoring a development in
practice, comparing different approaches?

***Manageable*:** The question you ask must be within your ability to
tackle. For example, are you able to *access* people, statistics, or
documents from which to collect the data you need to address the
question fully? Can this data be accessed within the limited *time* and
*resources* you have available to you? Sometimes a research question
appears feasible, but when you start your literature review, it proves
otherwise.

***Substantial and (within reason) original:*** The question should not
simply copy questions asked in other papers. It shows your own
imagination and your ability to construct and develop research issues.
And it needs to give sufficient scope to develop into a research paper.

***Clear and simple:*** Getting this clear and thought-through is one of
the hardest parts of your work. If you create a clear and simple
research question, you may find that it becomes more complex as you
think about the situation you are studying and undertake the literature
review.

***Interesting:*** This is key! The question needs to be one that
interests you and is likely to remain intriguing for the duration of the
project. There are two traps to be avoided. Make sure that you have a
real, grounded interest in your research question, and that you can
explore this in an academic paper. It is your interest that will
motivate you to keep working and to produce a good research paper.


# Learning Activity {#header}

::: reflect
The Master of Arts in Leadership program values the application of best
practices to your personal and professional practice. Before we get into
some of the concrete realities of accessing scholarly literature, we
would like you to take time to reflect on and articulate some of the
salient **leadership interests** in your personal and professional life
and practice. At the end of the MA Leadership program (in LDRS 697 &
698) you will get an opportunity to create a project based on a salient
leadership problem/interest. It is good to start thinking about what the
topic may be now so that you can use the assignments in this course to
start preparing for your final project.
