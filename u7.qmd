## The Purpose of APA 7

In professional and academic writing, APA 7 formatting serves as a critical guide for consistency, clarity, and credibility. Established by the American Psychological Association (APA), APA format is widely used in fields such as psychology, education, and social sciences. But why is it important, and how does it relate to professionalism and leadership?

#### Why APA 7 Matters for Professionalism {.unnumbered}

Using APA style is not just about following rules; it demonstrates a commitment to precision and attention to detail. A well-structured, accurately formatted document reflects professionalism and respect for the work of others, as it prioritizes clear communication and proper citation of sources. By adhering to APA guidelines, writers convey their information clearly, minimize ambiguity, and ensure their audience can easily follow and verify their sources. This fosters trust and credibility, qualities that are essential for servant leadership and a professional reputation.

#### Why APA 7 Matters for Leadership {.unnumbered}

Effective leadership requires solid ideas and the ability to communicate those ideas effectively and responsibly. APA formatting supports leadership by providing a standardized way to present research, insights, and recommendations that others can easily understand. Leaders who use APA demonstrate ethical responsibility by giving proper credit to the work of others, thereby modeling respect for intellectual property and encouraging a culture of accountability. In this way, using APA 7 aligns with servant leadership principles by placing the needs of others first, and fostering a climate of trust and ethical behavior [@coetzerFunctionsServantLeader2017; @mcmahoneServantLeadershipTeachable2012]. Furthermore, mastering APA style highlights a leader’s commitment to fostering accountability and a climate of ethical behavior.

Additionally, as servant leaders strive toward ethical practices, APA is a tool for exhibiting accountability by attributing ideas responsibly. This culture of accountability extends beyond APA adherence, setting a standard that encourages ethical, respectful communication and stewardship of knowledge. By promoting accurate citations, servant leaders cultivate an environment that respects the intellectual contributions of all, enhancing organizational integrity and ethical behavior [@coetzerFunctionsServantLeader2017; @mcmahoneServantLeadershipTeachable2012].

Throughout LDRS 591, your instructor will guide you in exploring key elements of APA 7 formatting to elevate your writing and support you in developing professional, clear, and ethically responsible written communications that create a culture of trust and accountability.

## Title Page Formatting

Creating a title page in APA 7 format for your assignments is more than just a formality; It is an important step in presenting your work professionally. A well-structured title page clearly displays essential information, such as your name, the course, your instructor’s name, and the assignment date, making it easy for readers to identify your work. It sets the tone for the rest of your paper by showing attention to detail, an appreciation for academic standards, and respect for guidelines. Additionally, following APA 7 title page requirements models accountability and professionalism, preparing you for the academic and professional standards expected in your field.

## Headings

Using headings in APA 7 for your assignments is essential for clear organization and readability. Headings guide readers through your paper’s structure, making it easy to follow your main points and understand how each section connects to your overall argument. This logical flow not only enhances your work’s professionalism but also demonstrates your ability to communicate ideas clearly and concisely. By adhering to APA’s structured heading levels, you are practicing skills in organization and clarity; Qualities valued in both academic and professional writing. Using headings also makes it easier for others to locate specific information quickly, which is especially helpful in collaborative or evaluative settings.

## Citations

Imagine you have spent weeks working on a project at work; A presentation with detailed research and new ideas that you are excited to share with your team. Now, picture someone taking your presentation, removing your name, and presenting it as their own work without mentioning you. How would you feel?

Just as people expect acknowledgment for their own ideas and hard work, using citations in academic or professional writing gives credit to the original authors who inspired or informed our work. Citing sources shows respect for others’ contributions, demonstrating that you value their ideas enough to share them with others. This is not just about avoiding plagiarism; it is about building a culture of respect, trust, and professionalism. Properly formatted citations help ensure that others can verify and follow up on the sources you have used, creating a chain of knowledge that strengthens our shared understanding.

### Citations and Stewardship {.unnumbered}

Citing sources aligns closely with the concept of stewardship in servant leadership. Peter Block [-@blockStewardshipChoosingService2013] defines stewardship as "holding something in trust for another," (p. xx) a principle that underscores people’s responsibility to care for and respect others’ contributions. In servant leadership, stewardship means leaders hold knowledge, resources, and responsibilities in trust—not for personal gain, but for the benefit of the community and society.

Applying this principle, citing sources in our work becomes an act of stewardship. You are acknowledging and preserving the intellectual contributions of others and using them in a way that respects their origin and purpose. Just as servant leaders use openness and persuasion over control, citations allow people to transparently share ideas, enabling others to trace, verify, and build upon those ideas for the collective good. This practice reflects a commitment to serve the academic and professional communities by fostering a culture of respect, integrity, and shared knowledge.

### Citations and Indigenous Storytelling {.unnumbered}

In Indigenous storytelling, stewardship and proper acknowledgment are essential aspects of preserving and respecting knowledge. Land acknowledgments are an important practice in recognizing Indigenous stewardship and the original keepers of the land [@hansonOralTraditions2009]. For example, you may notice the land acknowledgement on the [course syllabus](https://learn.twu.ca/mod/resource/view.php?id=1171447){target="_blank"}:

<!-- !!!

[course syllabus](https://learn.twu.ca/mod/resource/view.php?id=1171447)
-->

"We acknowledge that Trinity Western University, Langley campus is located on the traditional ancestral unceded territory of the Stó:lō people."

This practice reflects the values of respect and responsibility toward those who have historically cared for and continue to care for the land.

Similarly, Indigenous oral traditions are rich with stories passed down through generations, where each storyteller holds a piece of collective memory and knowledge in trust, as noted by Elders and knowledge keepers. This stewardship of knowledge is not just about the storyteller; it is about honoring the voices and wisdom of those who came before [@hansonOralTraditions2009].

Just as citing sources in academic work gives credit to the original thinkers, land acknowledgments recognize Indigenous peoples as the rightful stewards of the land. This practice emphasizes respect and gratitude [@hansonOralTraditions2009], connecting to Peter Block’s [-@blockStewardshipChoosingService2013] idea of stewardship as "holding something in trust for another," (p. xx) recognizing the historical and ongoing relationship Indigenous Peoples have with the land. Additionally, just as citing a source respects the intellectual property of others, acknowledging original knowledge keepers of an Indigenous story honors those who have preserved this wisdom over generations.

Citations in Western academia give credit, while in Indigenous traditions, "oral footnoting" attributes the story to a specific elder or ancestor, reflecting the storyteller’s responsibility to the collective memory [@hansonOralTraditions2009]. This act of stewardship, both in academic and Indigenous contexts, upholds a culture of respect, ensuring that knowledge is shared ethically, responsibly, and for the benefit of future generations.

## References

As Indigenous storytelling practices and academic citations embody stewardship and foster a culture of sharing knowledge responsibly and respectfully, so do references. Like using citations, including references is another way to practice servant leadership in written communication.

A shift toward servant leadership in organizations today reflects a movement away from traditional, hierarchical structures to one rooted in ethical, compassionate, and inclusive leadership [@spearsCharacterServantLeadership2010]. This approach, defined by principles like stewardship, empathy, and commitment to the growth of others [@spearsCharacterServantLeadership2010], aligns deeply with the practice of using APA references in academic and professional writing. APA referencing allows people to ethically credit original thinkers and contributors, building trust and transparency in their work. From a servant leadership perspective, using citations is an act of stewardship; It involves holding knowledge in trust for others, using it responsibly, and ensuring that ideas are shared openly for the benefit of the entire community.

APA references also embody key servant leadership traits, such as commitment to the growth of others and building community. By providing accurate references, we not only acknowledge the efforts of others but also empower our readers to explore the original sources, deepening their understanding and engagement with the topic. This aligns with servant leadership’s dedication to individual growth and the creation of a collaborative, knowledge-sharing environment [@spearsCharacterServantLeadership2010]. In this way, references help build a community of learning, where ideas circulate ethically and openly.

Further, servant leaders rely on awareness and foresight, seeing the broader impacts of their actions on others [@spearsCharacterServantLeadership2010]. By referencing sources, writers exercise these qualities, understanding that their work does not stand alone but is part of a larger discourse. This approach supports a responsible, forward-thinking culture where ideas are treated with respect and integrity, creating a positive and ethical academic and professional environment.
