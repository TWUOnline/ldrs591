<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>What research design was used to guide the study? Was it justified? (2)</b></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Plano-Clark and Creswell suggest that a case study research design is “a set of qualitative procedures used to explore a bounded system in depth.” (Plano-Clark and Creswell, 2015, P 292). I believe that the qualitative research study conducted by Chan and So (2017) is a case study research design. In this study, Chan and So are providing an in-depth exploration on the effect of the delivery of a program, by a teacher, on the development of servant leadership traits on a group of high school students. The system is bounded, which Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) suggest as a quality of a case study research design. (Plano-Clark and Creswell, 2015, P 293). It is bounded, as it is set within a school environment over time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">To my knowledge, Chan and So (2017) did not justify their research design. I was slightly torn when deciding whether or not this was a case study research design or a grounded theory research design. Plano-Clark and Creswell suggest tips or keywords to look for in a grounded theory research design. Chan and So (2017) did not use these terms. This led me to believe that it is a case study research design. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I rate this research a 2 in this category as the research design was not justified. </span>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Does the qualitative research design address the study’s purpose? (3)</b></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Chan and So (2017), used focus group interviews to “explore a possible pathway to cultivate servant leadership attributes among learners in secondary schooling.” (Chan and S0, 2017, P 19). “The results of this study showed that the co-curricular program provided opportunities for learners to develop the attributes of servant leaders.” (Chan and So, 2017, P 25). </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The purpose of the study was to determine if servant leadership qualities could be developed in adolescent youth. The results indicated that the participants in this study developed servant leadership traits. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The research design conducted provides a rich exploration that satisfies the purpose of the study, which Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) suggest as an indicator of a higher quality research design. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Rating: 3.    </span>
