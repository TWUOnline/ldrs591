<span style="font-weight: 400">Stone et. Al, (2003), discuss that the underlying focus of transformational and servant leadership is how the leader focus’ on the people. “While transformational leaders and servant leaders both show concern for their followers, the overriding focus of the servant leader is upon service to their followers. The transformational leader has a greater concern for getting followers to engage in and support organizational objectives.” (Stone et. al, 2003, 354). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Evidence-based decision making is important for various reasons. Making decisions based on evidence and facts reduces the influence of personal bias. If the goal of a transformational servant leader is to put the interests of the follower at the heart of the decision-making process, then they need to earn the respect and the trust of the followers. If the leader’s decision-making is biased, then the follower will feel like his or her viewpoints are not being carefully examined, valued and considered in the decision-making process which will cause them to lose trust and not want to be a follower. An effective transformational servant leader should consider all viewpoints and perspectives and base their decisions on evidence. </span>
