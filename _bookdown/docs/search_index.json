Course Description This course provides an overview of the process, critical analysis, and associated skills required for scholarship and research. This course is designed for learners who may have little experience in the area of research, and will provide an introduction to scholarly inquiry and various research approaches being used in the field of leadership. The aim of this course is to provide learners with the skills necessary to become critical consumers, and discriminating users, of research. This course is not intended as a research methods course that will develop advanced or even intermediate skills in empirical investigation in quantitative and qualitative methods. Rather, the course provides an introductory “toolkit” that will support your work on your applied MA in Leadership activities and in your further professional work. The syllabus includes key information about the course schedule, assignments, and policies. Please read the full course syllabus located at the bottom of the Welcome page in Moodle. Course Learning Outcomes By the end of this course, the learner will be able to: Evaluate potential research questions based upon problems in the leadership domain and distinguish among appropriate methods whereby to address these questions. Conduct a thorough review of scholarly literature using library and internet search skills. Critique research studies using skills of critical-analytic thinking. Develop scholarly written communication skills that demonstrate higher ordered thinking and analysis. Demonstrate critical thinking and analytic skills characteristic of a rigorous approach to scholarship. Appraise the research process based upon the values and ethical standards of servant leadership. Please note: This course is a pre-requisite for LDRS 697-698.

As such, the University considers it a serious offence when an individual knowingly acts, or fails to act, in a manner to gain unearned academic credit. It is the student’s responsibility to inform him or herself as to what constitutes academic misconduct, and to address any questions to the individual professors with whom he or she is dealing. It will be assumed that you have read, understand, and agree to the information provided at the Academic Dishonesty Policy website. If you have any questions at all please contact your instructor. Late Assignments Policy Assignments should be submitted on the due date in order to receive full credit. The penalty for unexcused late assignments will be determined by the following scale: For each day or part thereof late, the instructor will reduce the assigned grade by one- third of a letter; e.g., “A” to “A-,” “B+” to “B.” Requests for extensions must be communicated in advance of the due date. Special circumstances may warrant additional consideration. No late papers will be accepted beyond a week after the due date. Class Participation Policy To ensure consistent participation for classes in the MA LEAD/MAEL programs, it is important for all learners to maintain regular attendance to scheduled face-to-face class times. Missing class time in a face-to-face class hinders learning and the success of those enrolled (individuals/ teams) in MA LEAD/MAEL courses. To ensure learner success in the program, learners missing two class sessions* or more will: Not be allowed to remain in the course. Be required to take the course again. Be unable to attend further classes for the course in the same semester. Note: Students in online courses are expected to participate in discussion forums and group assignments as directed in Moodle. Forum participation in online courses is a significant part of the course final grade. Program Grade Submission Policy ALL course work must be submitted for final grading within 14 days following the course end date. The instructor has to submit grades to the Registrar within 14 days of the course end date. In extenuating circumstances, a provision is made for an INC to be entered pending final assignment of a course mark. Additional Resources Writing Centre Sessions Please note that you may be required to use the support of our writing center coaches for this course. Plan to book your appointments well in advance, so that the coaches have time to work with you on each of your assignments. The Writing Centre is available to assist all students with their academic writing assignments in any subject at any stage of the writing process. This is a free service. Online Writing Sessions are available, for more information visit To make an appointment, visit www1.twu.ca/writingcentre.

Inquiry is “the process of developing skills to arrive at understandings of a problem, an issue, or a phenomenon, through the process of asking good questions, searching out good evidence, and arriving at well-reasoned conclusions” (Penner, 2017). By now you are well aware of the applied nature of the MA in Leadership program. This feature may be an important part of what attracted you to the program! Why then study research methods? Why worry about scholarly inquiry? This course in scholarly inquiry will help you to develop systematic thinking skills applicable in all realms of leadership and everyday life. As Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015) note, research adds to your professional knowledge, informs your position in policy debates, and contributes to the improvement in your practice (pp. 4-5). Moreover, our leadership practice is ideally evidence-based; that is, based on evidence derived from systematic scholarly inquiry. 1.1.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read and Reflect According to Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015), “research is a process of steps used to collect and analyze information in order to increase our knowledge about a topic or an issue” (p.4) and it is different then informal research. 📺 To begin this learning activity, watch the following video where Dr. Strong explains “What is Scholarly Inquiry?” 📖 Read Chapters 1 and 2 of the Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015). ✏️ Start a Reflective Learning Journal. This journal is not submitted or graded, but is an opportunity for you to reflect on, and engage with, the course content. The questions posed will often help you prepare for your assignments and are designed to help you successfully achieve the learning outcomes for each unit. Please complete the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal. In your reflective learning journal, explain how you would define research. Describe what your experience is with “research”. (Have you taken an undergraduate statistics course? Is this your first time learning about research? Have you published your own scientific paper?) Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. See below for more information on keeping a Reflective Learning Journal. Introduction to the Reflective Journal A reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. There is no correct way to create this journal; rather, it is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning. Journals can consist of traditional note taking on paper, or in a word document, you can create mind maps, pictures, or just write stream-of-consciousness, you can record your thoughts in an audio file, write down important quotes, create sketches, or drawings: whatever you choose to include. Experiment and have fun. The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the course’s readings, activities, and discussions with your instructor and your fellow students. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work. Throughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even outside of our scheduled course activities. Common Questions Used for Reflective Journaling In your view, what were the most important points in the readings, videoclips, or discussions with your fellow students and tutors? What information did you already know? What new knowledge, ideas, or perspectives have you gained? What information was easy to remember or learn? Why? What concepts did you find more difficult? Why? How can you apply this knowledge to your work or current experience? How has this knowledge helped you to make sense of your current or previous experience? Has your understanding of a personal or work-related situation changed after studying these concepts? Did you agree or disagree with any of the material? If yes, how did you react and why? If you could have the opportunity to engage in further learning, what would it be? What further questions would like to ask the author of your readings? What other articles, books or discussions would be of interest? This journal is not submitted or graded, but is an opportunity for you to reflect on, and engage with, the course content. The questions posed will often help you prepare for your assignments and are designed to help you successfully achieve the learning outcomes for each unit. 1.2 Leadership and Scholarly Inquiry On what basis are sound decisions made? What evidence do leaders rely upon for best outcomes? The need to evaluate evidence for best practices in leadership decision-making is widely acknowledged. Patton (2001) observes that “the emphasis on knowledge generation disseminated in the form of best practices has swept like wildfire through all sectors of society” (p. 329). We often refer to the vision of best practices in leadership within the MA in Leadership program. What do we mean by this? Put simply, “best practices” refers to those practices and initiatives that result in the best possible outcomes. How do we know what best practice is? The process of identifying best practices begins with an understanding of common sources of evidence available to leaders. Take a moment to think about a recent decision you made as a leader. On what did you base this decision? Previous experience? Values? Company policy? Empirical evidence (e.g., data derived from research)? Expert opinion? Systematic inquiry (as represented by research) is one tool that leaders can use to inform best practices and their decision making process. Systematic inquiry is hardly new – in first century writings we see in the Bible evidence of systematic, logical, and empirical inquiry. Consider the following passage from Luke, a physician trained in empirical methods of his day: Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. (Luke 1:1-4, NIV) How does the research process differ from managerial activities such as decision-making and problem solving? Research shares with decision-making and problem-solving the systematic and disciplined procedure of identifying an issue/problem, deciding on an approach, formulating a plan, collecting and analyzing data, drawing conclusions and implementing decisions based on this rigorous process. What distinguishes research from generic or everyday problem solving is its commitment to advance or generate knowledge that typically will be communicated to the larger academic or scientific community. The past two decades have produced remarkable growth in the area of foundations of research and research methodologies within natural, applied, and social sciences and humanities. Boyer’s Model of Scholarship The Master of Arts in Leadership program is focused on applied scholarship. In defining this, Boyer’s four-part Model of Scholarship (1997) is useful. Boyer’s typology identifies four domains of scholarship: discovery, integration, application, and teaching. The model is discussed by Marta Nibert (2011) in her paper titled Boyer’s Model of Scholarship. In the section titled Application she notes that the scholarship of . . . application, focuses on using research findings and innovations to remedy societal problems. Included in this category are service activities that are specifically tied to one’s field of knowledge and professional activities. Beneficiaries of these activities include commercial entities, non-profit organizations, and professional associations. (para. 4) Though Nibert’s primary audience is the professoriate, this material is relevant for MA in Leadership learners. Application is highlighted because the Master of Arts in Leadership was designed to focus primarily on the scholarship of application, although work in the capstone will likely include one or more of the other domains. Boyer’s Scholarship of Discovery is the type of scholarship associated with traditional scholarly research. “Research is a systematic process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting information (data) in order to increase our understanding of a phenomenon abut which we are interested or concerned” (Leedy &amp; Ormrod 2010, p. 2). Boyer’s Scholarship of Discovery is often referred to as primary research. Primary research is narrowly focused, and contributes to the body of knowledge by helping us to understand one isolated part of reality in detail in the hopes that this understanding can be generalized to some degree to a broader part of reality. The Scholarship of Discovery (in traditional research) falls into two distinct genres: quantitative research and qualitative research. Each of these genres manifest in numerous variations, including hybrid models involving both quantitative and qualitative elements, designed for and suited to differing research questions. Boyer’s Scholarship of Integration is “the attempt to arrange relevant bits of knowledge and insight from different disciplines into broader patterns that reflect the actual interconnectedness of the world” (Boyer cited in Jacobsen &amp; Jacobsen, 2004, p. 51). Scholarship of Integration often demands interdisciplinary collaboration and requires that the critical analysis and review of knowledge be followed by the creative synthesis of views and insights in such a way that what is known speaks to specific topics or issues. The Scholarship of Application is “the scholarship of engagement; seeking to close the gap between values in the academy and the needs of the larger world” (Boyer cited in Jacobsen &amp; Jacobsen, 2004, p. 51). In the Scholarship of Application, knowledge is applied to the solution of societal needs and practice. In most cases, knowledge stemming from the Scholarship of Discovery and the Scholarship of Integration informs the solutions to particular problems. The Scholarships of Discovery and Integration are often associated with the context of formal education. The Scholarship of Application may happen within formal education contexts, it is most often associated with other settings (Bosher 2009, p. 6). Finally, the Scholarship of Teaching is “the scholarship of sharing knowledge” (Boyer cited in Jacobsen &amp; Jacobsen, 2004, p. 51). The Scholarship of Teaching involves the reflective analysis of the knowledge about teaching and learning. This knowledge base itself is the product of the Scholarships of Discovery, Integration and Application combining as “active ingredients of a dynamic and iterative teaching process” (Bosher, 2009, p. 5). Boyer’s typology originally identified as the Scholarship of Teaching has been expanded somewhat and is widely known today in the literature as the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (Bosher, 2009). You have undoubtedly already noticed an ambiguity: If the entire model is called the Scholarship of Teaching, how is it that the last element depicted in the chart above is also called the Scholarship of Teaching? This ambiguity is evident, Bosher contends that Boyer’s four domains were conceived holistically as elements that overlap and interact, not as discrete elements, appearing in any predictable order, and are better viewed as an operating system than a list of discrete elements (2009, pp. 4-5). 1.2.1 Learning Activity: Watch and Reflect 📺 Watch the following video where Dr. Patton introduces you to the concept of research as a scholar-practitioner. ✏️ Next, answer the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal.** Describe at least one example of a decision you have made as a leader. Consider the factors that went into that decision making process (e.g., values, research, policy, past experience, expert opinion). What do you consider as “evidence” in your decision making? In your own words, why is evidence-based decision-making important in leadership? Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. 1.3 Philosophical Foundations of Research Three Foundational Questions A professor of mine often observed that a fundamental attribute of being human is to ask questions. Humanity is especially interested in three fundamental questions: What is real? What is true? What is good? The philosophical category of metaphysics is concerned with what is real, and what is the nature of reality. The philosophical category of epistemology is concerned with what is true, and what is the nature and process of knowing. The philosophical category of axiology is concerned with what is good and how we can determine the nature of goodness. Much of history is a chronicle of the different ways people have answered these three fundamental questions. How we answer these questions reveals our perspective, or our worldview. Every person bases his or her own thoughts, decisions, and actions on what is called a worldview. A worldview is “an interpretive framework through which one makes sense of themselves, other people, and the world around them” (Geisler &amp; Watkins, 2003). It is like a pair of glasses that you wear when you are observing things about yourself, other people and the world in which you live. Here is a short video by the Impact 360 Institute (2014) that explains “What’s your worldview?” A discussion about worldview, or your perspective, is foundational to what we want to accomplish in this course. Throughout this course I will ask these questions: On what basis are sound decisions made? What evidence do leaders rely upon for best outcomes when they are making decisions? Each of us has a preference for obtaining truth or a framework for understanding ourselves, others, and the world, and personal preferences abound. Researchers and consumers of research (i.e. us) approach knowledge and learning and life with a certain perspective and it is important to understand that perspective before you jump into the research journey and it is certainly something to consider in positions of leadership. ResearchParadigms (Image Source: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40670-019-00898-9) Here is a really helpful video by Laura Killam (2013) that explains Paradigms, Ontology and Epistemology. It is important to be aware of your worldview before you enter into the research journey because it will inform the types of questions that you ask as well as the processes that you use to find the answers to your questions. As an example, let me explain a Christian worldview and explore how this worldview can be applied to the research journey. A Christian worldview asserts that God has created the world and everything in it, and that truth is arrived at through a study of God’s specific revelation (the Bible) and general revelation (creation). Christians believe not only in studying and understanding truth, but they also believe in a personal God that has revealed Himself through this created world. The Christian worldview can be summarized in three words: Creation, Fall and Redemption. Let me unpack these terms. Initially, when God created the world, it was all good and whole and harmonious. God created man in His own image. Originally man was created healthy in body, soul and spirit (Genesis 1:26-27, 31). As people rebelled against God, causing the Fall, the presence of sin corrupted all aspects of God’s good creation, and brought about much suffering. Where there was formerly harmony and wholeness, we now experience ourselves, our relationships and the world around us as fractured, broken and full of dis-ease (a literal discomfort with who we are) (Genesis 3). Despite the brokenness, Christians believe that God is actively working to bring about restoration and wholeness to His entire creation. Through Christ’s redemptive work on the cross, people are reconciled to God and are challenged to make all things as they were created and meant to be – very good. Redemption means that all things are made new in Christ (Colossians 1:19-20). The framework of Creation, Fall and Redemption is important because it allows us to enter into a discussion about research with confidence knowing that God’s redemptive work touches this area. Christians believe that we are called to study creation with the desire to take the knowledge we gain and use it to help and bless others; to work toward the restoration and healing of God’s creation. Christians are called to inquire, to investigate, to ask questions, always with a view to serve others. It is beyond the purpose of this course to go deeper into this topic other than to make the point that our way of knowing and understanding the world around us (i.e., our worldview) influences how we approach all of life, including how we approach research and how we use research to inform our decision-making process. 1.4 The Research Process Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) define research as “a process of steps used to collect and analyze information in order to increase our knowledge about a topic or issue” (p. 4). Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) identify eight steps in the research process which provide us with a useful framework that describes what researchers do when they conduct their studies. These steps help us understand the information that is included in their reports. Listed below are each of the eight steps in the research process. The whole process begins with identifying the research problem. This step is vitally important. The statement of the research problem is the very foundation that subsequent research is built upon, and quite literally guides each and every step moving forward. A literature review is a summary of the “state of knowledge” in a given area. This step is the primary focus of this course and involves locating relevant scholarly literature, and analyzing, synthesizing and summarizing what precedent literature has to say about a specific topic. The purpose of research includes identifying the objective of a study (e.g., purpose statement). This information is typically expressed in a few research questions or hypotheses. Next, it is important to choose a research design. This step involves describing an overall plan or approach of the study and also explains the methods used to carry out the plan. Selecting participants and collecting data includes who will be the participants, how you will collect information from those participants, and what permission you need to obtain in order to collect the information. Analyzing data involves systematic processes to make sense of the information that has been gathered. We call this process “results,” which are then reported in forms appropriate to the research method (e.g., statistics or words). Drawing conclusions means interpreting the results and explaining how the conclusions relate to the research questions/hypotheses, and/or similar studies. There is also a discussion of limitations of the study and often suggestions of implications for the intended audiences, for practice and for future research. Disseminating and evaluating the research. Usually the term “disseminated” means “published.” The most common way that research is disseminated is in journals dedicated to publishing primary research. 1.4.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read and Reflect 📺 Begin this learning activity by watching the following video where Dr. Strong explains Philosophical Foundations of Research. Next, reading the following articles: 📖 Wallace (2007). Servant leadership: A worldview perspective 📖 Brown &amp; Dueñas,(2020). A Medical Science Educator’s Guide to Selecting a Research Paradigm: Building a Basis for Better Research. ✏️ Next, take a few minutes to think about your own worldview. Then answer the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal. What motivates you? What are you driven by? (e.g. funding, social justice, the common good) Do you believe there is “one verifiable reality,” or that “multiple socially constructed realities” exist? What do you think counts as knowledge within the world? How do you think knowledge acquired? Based on the Brown and Duenas article, what research paradigm resonates with you the most? (i.e., positivist, post-positivist, social constructivist, critical theory). Why does it resonate with you? Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. 1.5 Asking Significant Questions The most important part of the research process is beginning with a good research question. This is something that will be highly relevant to completing of most of your assignments in this course. The research process often starts when you ask a question about something that you observe: How, What, When, Who, Which, Why, or Where? Questions can be based on what you observe in the real world, or on intuition or a “gut feeling”. The question that you select is the cornerstone of your work in this course. The assignments you will be working on will revolve around finding an answer to the question you are posing. It is important to select a question that is going to be interesting to work on for the length of this course and a question that is specific enough to allow you to find the answer. The Higher Education Academy and Sheffield Hallam University (2005) have developed an excellent guide for Formulating the Research Question. According to the authors, good questions are: Relevant: The question will be of interest to people in your field and arise from issues raised in the literature or in practice. You should be able to establish a clear purpose for your research in relation to the chosen field. For example, are you filling a gap in knowledge, analyzing professional practice, monitoring a development in practice, comparing different approaches? Manageable: The question you ask must be within your ability to tackle. For example, are you able to access people, statistics, or documents from which to collect the data you need to address the question fully? Can this data be accessed within the limited time and resources you have available to you? Sometimes a research question appears feasible, but when you start your literature review, it proves otherwise. Substantial and (within reason) original: The question should not simply copy questions asked in other papers. It shows your own imagination and your ability to construct and develop research issues. And it needs to give sufficient scope to develop into a research paper. Clear and simple: Getting this clear and thought-through is one of the hardest parts of your work. If you create a clear and simple research question, you may find that it becomes more complex as you think about the situation you are studying and undertake the literature review. Interesting: This is key! The question needs to be one that interests you and is likely to remain intriguing for the duration of the project. There are two traps to be avoided. Make sure that you have a real, grounded interest in your research question, and that you can explore this in an academic paper. It is your interest that will motivate you to keep working and to produce a good research paper. 1.5.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read and Complete The Master of Arts in Leadership program values the application of best practices to your personal and professional practice. Before we get into some of the concrete realities of accessing scholarly literature, we would like you to take time to reflect on and articulate some of the salient leadership interests in your personal and professional life and practice. At the end of the MA Leadership program (in LDRS 697 &amp; 698) you will get an opportunity to create a project based on a salient leadership problem/interest. It is good to start thinking about what the topic may be now so that you can use the assignments in this course to start preparing for your final project. 📺 Begin this learning activity by watching the following video where Dr. Strong discusses how to asking significant questions: 📖 Next, read Frederikson &amp; Phelps (n.d.) chapter 3 “How to get started”. ✏️ Finally, take some time to answer the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal. Where do you see the greatest need for change in the field you want to work as a leader? What would you propose to change in your field and why? Try using the following three statements to help you get some clarity about what exactly you want to investigate. If you can fill out these statements, then you most likely have a narrow enough topic with enough direction to perform some great research. I am researching ____________ (What? Topic) because I want to find out ________ (So What? Issue/question) in order to ________ (Now What? Application/Purpose). Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. (Source: https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/introduction/researchproblem) Unit 1 Summary In this unit you have learned about what scholarly inquiry is, what is a worldview and how it can shape the questions that we ask. You have also learned about the importance of scholarly inquiry for leadership, the implications of evidence based decision making for leaders, and how to develop a good research question. Unit 1 Assessment Prepare for your Discussion After completing the learning activities in this unit, you will be asked to discuss the following questions in your learning pod/or discussion post this week: Part 1: Begin by introducing yourself and explaining what your experience is with research. Next, discuss what you have learned about the differences between informal research (everyday problem solving) and scholarly inquiry (formal research). Part 2: Finally, review the Brown and Dueñas (2020) article and answer the following questions: What research paradigm resonated with you the most? If you had to choose one, which one would you pick and why? Checking Your Learning Now that you have completed the learning activities and assignments for this unit, check the list below to see if you can do the following: Can you distinguish between informal research and scholarly inquiry?

This unit will help you gain familiarity with various genres of scholarly literature and help you get a sense of what scholarly sources of information are available, given your own research interests. In this unit you will also gain first-hand experience in locating and organizing and evaluating relevant scholarly literature. The learning activities in this unit will walk you through some very practical readings and video tutorials on how to access and evaluate scholarly literature. Let’s begin! Accessing scholarly literature can be a frustrating process. The key is to start at the beginning with a good plan and keep yourself organized. Organizing tools are important both to streamline your literature search and to summarize and synthesize. As you begin your literature search (library books, online periodicals, internet search), organize your search into general topic areas and more specific keywords. It is very helpful to have some sense of the various fields that will potentially inform your research interests. Part of your planning and organizing is to recognize various genres of scholarly literature and to be aware of the limitations inherent to each. A very helpful discussion is provided by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) on pages 10-12. There are three different categories of documents where you can find research reports: summaries and books, journal articles and early stage materials such as conference presentations. Many times you will see this sequence followed: A research project is completed, and the research is first published in a Mater’s thesis or PhD dissertation, or as a paper in a symposium or conference. The research report then goes to a professional journal for publication and eventually it is incorporated into a book. By the time a dissertation is successfully defended, the actual research may have been conducted two to three years earlier. It could easily take another three years for a journal article to make it through the peer-review process and be published. Therefore, the research referenced in the journal article could be at least five years old. It could easily take another five years for high quality publishers to work through their review processes and publish something in a book. Obviously, what you lose in this process is cutting edge thought. The chart below summarizes the relative advantages and disadvantages of each genre of scholarly literature. You can refer to Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) pages 10-12 for more details. Genre Advantages Disadvantages Utility Summaries (encyclopedias and handbooks) Generally highest quality. Tend to be dated. Establish a general working knowledge of the field. Books Generally high quality. Can be dated. Establish mainstream thought. Most foundational literature is found in books. Journal Articles Generally high quality.* Provide a clear description of actual research. Generally more current than books or summaries. Generally will not give a full development of application and implications. Best available balance between quality and currency. Early stage materials (conference papers, dissertations, newspapers, personal websites etc.) Most current cutting edge ideas are found here. Little review for quality (except for dissertations). Ideas are not usually well developed. Valuable for establishing trends in current thought. Use cautiously. Note: High quality journals are determined by the peer review process, the journals impact factor (IF) and by professional reputation. The impact factor is a measure of the frequency with which the average article in a journal has been cited in a particular year. The IF is used to measure the importance or rank of a journal by calculating the times its articles are cited. The IF can be found on the home page of most online journals. Peer review is the process used by publishers and editors of academic/scholarly journals to ensure that the articles they publish meet the accepted standards of their discipline. Manuscripts being considered for publication are sent to independent experts in the same field (the author’s scholarly or scientific peers). They evaluate the quality of the scholarship, reliability of findings, relevance to the field, appropriateness for the journal, etc. Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) provide a very useful tip regarding what sources of literature you should access. They suggest that although you are probably used to searching for books on a particular topic, it is important to “focus on reading recent research studies published as journal articles to learn the most up-to-date information in your profession” (p. 11). As a general rule, articles published within the past 10 years should give you a good idea of what is current in your profession. 2.1.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read, and Search for Journal Articles 📺 Watch the following video where Dr. Strong explains why it is important to access scholarly literature (Note: This video is 31 minutes in length). 📖 Next, read chapters 2 and 4 in the Frederikson &amp; Phelps (n.d.) text. These two chapters discuss sources of information, database searches, and searching the library catalog. 📺 Watch the tutorial “Preparing a research question for a database search”. Click on the library link “How to search for articles.” Begin by selecting one of video tutorials in the section on multi-disciplinary databases such as “Academic Search Ultimate.” Watch the video tutorial to get an idea of how to search for a topic in a multi-disciplinary database. 📖 Keeping in mind the topic and specific question(s) you identified in Assignment 1, use the Academic Search Ultimate database at the TWU library to locate a good example of a journal article. To do this you will need to: Go to the TWU library home page. In the first search window, click the databases tab and then click the articles and databases link which brings you to a different screen. In the Database Guide screen you will need to select “A-B” from the A-Z list of databases at the bottom of this page. The first database that appears on the next screen is “Academic Search Ultimate.” Select this database. You will be asked to sign in as a student with your pass ID and password to access the online database. Once you have signed in, then you will be able to type your topic or question in the search window of “Academic Search Ultimate.” Searching for Books Go to TWU library homepage and click “How to search for books”. Begin by selecting one of video tutorials in the section “searching for e-books” such as “searching for e-books in the classic catalogue.” Watch the video tutorial to get an idea of how to search for a topic found in an e-book. Keeping in mind the topic and specific question(s) you identified in Assignment 1, use the library catalog to locate a good example of an e-book. ✏️ Answer the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal. Briefly describe your experiences in the search for a journal and an e-book, what worked well, what did not, what key search terms did you use, what databases did you search? Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. 2.2 Utilizing Scholarly Literature After you have determined what sources you will be accessing, you need to conduct a search, and then keep track of your literature search strategy and results. The simplest way to do this is to use an online reference manager that will help you collect, organize, cite and share your references according to the referencing style you will be using. There are several free, online reference managers available such as Refworks, Zotero, and EndNote. TWU library has a research guide that describes how to use EndNote. This library guide will help you sign up for an EndNote account and also help you figure out how to use EndNote to download and store your citations in folders and then input citations into Word documents and create reference lists. After you have retrieved the results from your database searches and organized them in folders in your reference manager, you need to select documents to review. Begin by reviewing the titles and abstracts. For those articles that you deem worthwhile, skim the article itself to determine if it is relevant to your topic. Read the introduction and literature review and examine the reference list. As you collect relevant literature you can either enter it into a summary chart or just collect the abstracts. There is no single correct way to do this—but you will need to develop some sort of system that works for you. An example of a summary chart is provided below: Category Description Reference Cite full reference in APA (6th edition) format for a reference list. Research Problem Describe the research problem and relevant background information. Include page references for both your summaries and direct quotations. Purpose, Research question or Hypothesis Describe the purpose, research question and hypothesis. Include page references for summaries and quotations. Data Collection/Procedure Describe how the researcher collected data. What participants did they use? What measures did they use? What method was used? Results/Findings Describe the results or findings. The research process is not always linear. You may have a great research question or research topic in mind, but as you begin your initial database and library searches you may find yourself changing or refining your topic. Sometimes you will not find any information on the topic you have chosen because the topic is so new and no one has done any research on the topic yet. Sometimes you will not find any information on the topic you have chosen because you are not using the right search terms or keywords. If you are having difficulty finding research articles and books on your topic then try to re-examine the keywords you are using for your search. Look up synonyms for your keywords and try to find the terms that are used in the research literature. Another helpful tip is to look at the reference list of any articles or books that seem closest to your topic. This can help you to see what sources other authors have used and can be a helpful strategy to track down articles and books on your topic. 2.2.1 Learning Activity: Read, Watch and Reflect 📖 Begin this learning activity by reading Chapter 6 of the Fredericksen and Phelps (n.d.) text. 📺 Next, go to the TWU library homepage and click “How to develop research skills.” Begin by watching all of the video tutorials under the section “upgrading your research skills.” There are several short videos in this section on Boolean searches, search history, and other search techniques. ✏️ Answer the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal. Briefly describe your experiences with upgrading your research skills. What did you find worked well, what did not? What boolean searches did you use, what inclusion or exclusion criteria did you select? Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. 2.3 Evaluating Scholarly Literature After you have found several articles and books related to your research topic and skimmed them for relevance, the next step is to evaluate your information sources. Unfortunately, not all information that you will come across is going to be credible and reliable. Just because you find articles and books at the library does not mean that the information will be accurate or of high quality. As an MA Leadership student, and as a professional, it is imperative that you are able to critically evaluate information you are reading in order to conduct quality research yourself, inform policies and improve your professional practice. To evaluate a source for quality and credibility you need to consider the following: Authority: Who is the author? What are the author’s credentials (educational background, past writing experience, expertise on the topic)? Is the author’s name cited in other sources or reference lists? A simple google search will help you explore these questions. Currency: When was the source published? Is the source current or out of date for your topic? Remember the general rule is to use sources that have been published within the past 10 years. Purpose: What is the author’s intention? Is the information the author’s opinion or is the author communicating evidence-based results? Who is the author’s intended audience? Is it the academic community or consumers? Is the author’s point of view objective and impartial? Is the language in the article or book free of emotion or bias? Content: What kind of information is provided in the article or book? Is it a research article, popular book or opinion piece on a blog? Is the information provided backed up with references or sources? What is the length of the reference list? Publication type/process: Who published the source? Was the source peer-reviewed? Is the publisher a university press or a large reputable publisher? Is it from a government agency? Is the source self-published? Bias and special interests: According to Panucci and Williams (2010) bias can occur during all phases of research from design, implementation, and analysis to publication. Therefore, careful attention to the interpretation of research results and study design will help identify bias. Driscoll and Brizee (2017) suggest that when it comes to publishing research reports, “most major publishers are out to make a profit and will either not cater to special interest groups or will clearly indicate when they are catering to special interest groups”. Additional sources for finding scholarly literature: I also wanted to mention two other sources of information that you can use to gather information on your research topic. The first is viewing the TED talk videos. These videos are a great resource to help you become familiar with a researcher and their work on a specific topic. You can search almost any topic on the TED website, the videos are usually under 20 minutes, and are very good. You can find TED site here: https://www.ted.com. The second resource is using the reference lists at the back of a book or of a journal article on your topic. These are both great places to find additional sources of information on your topic and also help you become familiar with who is publishing information in your area of interest. 2.3.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read, and Reflect 📺 Begin this learning activity by watching the following video where Dr. Strong explains how to evaluate your sources. 📖 Next, read chapter 6: Evaluating Sources in the Fredericksen and Phelps (n.d.) text. 📺 Next, watch the following videos: - assessing online resources and evaluating a journal article. ✏️ Answer the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal at the bottom of this page. Briefly describe how you found your online sources and whether or not you think they will be helpful resources for your topic. What sources of information will you use the most to conduct research on your topic? How will you evaluate these sources to make sure they are credible and reliable sources of information? Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. Unit 2 Summary In this unit you have learned about the research process and what is involved in asking good research questions. You have learned how to identify different scholarly sources, how to access those sources through the TWU library, and how to keep track of your literature search strategies and results. In addition, you have learned how to critically evaluate scholarly sources. The activities in this unit are directly related to your third, fourth and final assignments in this course. Coming up next week in Unit 3 you will be discovering how to develop your professional scholarly voice, particularly through your scholarly writing. Unit 2 Assessment Prepare for your Discussion In your learning pod/discussion post this week, you will do some research on the benefits of a popular health topic. Begin by searching for literature on your topic. Choose an article, or blog post, or video, or other internet source that you found on your topic. Determine if your source is credible or not. What did you find out about the credibility of your source? Next, as a group you will evaluate the source of the information that you discovered by providing information about the following: Authority – Who is the author and who published the source? Currency – Is the source current or out of date? Purpose – What is the author’s intention? Is it stated clearly? Publication process – Has the article been peer reviewed? How do you know? Bias and special interests – Did the source indicate any conflicts of interest? Complete Assignment #1: Clarifying Your Research Interest. In this assignment, you will discuss your leadership interests (personal and/or professional) and generate research questions amenable to scholarly inquiry. Please see the instructions for this assignment under the Assignments tab. Checking Your Learning Now that you have completed the learning activities and assignments for this unit, check the list below to see if you can do the following: Can you identify a research interest and develop a good research question?

Boston, MA: Pearson. 3.1 Developing Your Professional Voice In Unit 3 you will be discovering how to develop your professional scholarly voice, specifically through your scholarly writing. This means that you will be reading content that will help you understand that there are different writing styles that are used in the world of academia and how important it is to use APA style in the MA Lead program. Your learning activities this week are focused on applying the APA standards for general aspects of writing, mechanics of writing and citing sources. You will also have a chance to apply these skills in assignment 3 which is the literature search and assignment 4 which is the scholarly article critique, and then continue to practice them in assignment 5 - the formal literature review. Let’s get started! When you are asked to write a scholarly paper in graduate school, what you are really being asked to do is to develop your professional voice (McDonald, 2011). A professional voice can be described as utilizing formal language, good vocabulary and appropriate tone in your written and oral communication (Walden University Writing Center, 2017). Characteristics of a strong professional voice are writing concisely, with clarity and precision, and appropriately citing your sources (McDonald, 2011). Developing your professional voice is important because some students will turn their papers into professional manuscripts that will be submitted to a journal or a book. Some students may be asked to present their work at a professional conference. McDonald suggests that “for most students, writing papers in graduate school is an exercise in presenting important information in an easy to understand and concise way” (p.125). A well developed professional voice can also benefit you in your professional context. For example, at work you may be asked to write a briefing document for your school or hospital board, or you may be asked to share your ideas with other professionals at a conference, or you may be asked to write a grant to fund your organizations new project. These are just three examples of professional situations where it is important to have a well-developed professional voice so that you can communicate in a clear and concise way. In order to communicate well, you need to have a system to organize your thoughts so that the information you are writing is presented in an organized and clear manner. There are a wide variety of publication styles that are employed today in universities and in scholarly publications. A few that you may be familiar with are Chicago style, MLA style, Turbian style and APA style. The American Psychological Association (APA) has developed a writing style that is used to establish a standard of written communication. This standard includes: the organization of content, writing style or writing mechanics, citing references, and how to prepare a manuscript for publication in certain disciplines (APA, 2010). The MA Leadership program uses the APA Manual (6th edition) as the model for formatting written work formally submitted. Aside from simplifying the work of your instructors by having everyone use the same format for a given paper, using APA style makes it easier for readers to understand a text by providing a familiar structure they can follow. Abiding by APA’s standards as a writer will allow you to: Provide readers with cues they can use to follow your ideas more efficiently. Provide readers with dates of publications to help them locate current information that may be of interest to them. Allow readers to focus more on your ideas by not distracting them with unfamiliar formatting. Establish your credibility in the field by demonstrating an awareness of your audience and their needs as fellow researchers. 3.1.1 Learning Activity: Watch and Reflect 📺 In this learning activity you will begin by watching the following video “The Power of Writing” by Dr. Jordan Peterson. In the video, Dr. Peterson explains the importance of writing. ✏️ Answer the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal. What is your previous experience with APA style? Discuss why you think scholarly writing could be important in your leadership context. Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. 3.2 What is Scholarly Writing? According to Heady (2013), graduate-level (or scholarly) writing is “clear, correct and concise, but it adds the elements of originality and discipline specific expertise” (p. 2). Heady suggests that graduate-level writing explores a topic or a research question in an original way, demonstrates extensive research done on the topic, has a strong organizational structure, and is written for a professional audience. The scholarly writer writes in a way that is skillful, engaging and organized well so that the paper moves from point to point allowing the reader to follow in a logical progression. Heady also states that “a good paper has a clear and obvious structure: you can enter it through a clear, well-composed introduction, you move from section to section, and you exit where you know you have been and what you have seen” (p. 73). Critical Thinking One of the distinguishing features of scholarly writing is the practice of critical thinking. Critical thinking is “that mode of thinking — about any subject, content, or problem — in which the thinker improves the quality of his or her thinking by skillfully analyzing, assessing and reconstructing it” (Foundation for Critical Thinking, 2015). In addition, critical thinking also involves creating new and original information, conclusions and ideas (Heady, 2013). Scholarly writing, should reflect higher levels of learning. According to Bloom’s (1956) taxonomy there are six levels of learning: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation. When you are writing a scholarly paper, the focus should not be on just identifying, comprehending material and applying it, your writing should also reflect analysis, synthesis and evaluation. What this means is that your writing (and your thinking) should be able to: * Break down ideas into parts and see how those parts relate and are organized to demonstrate analysis. * Re-arrange ideas into a new whole to demonstrate synthesis. * Make judgments based on internal evidence or external criteria to demonstrate evaluation. Structure and Organization Writing a scholarly paper often follows a very distinct organizational structure and includes: a title page, an introduction, methods and results, a discussion and a list of references. Let’s take a closer look at what should be included in each of these sections of a scholarly paper. Title Page: This is the first page of your paper and it should include a title that summarizes the main topic you will be discussing. It should also include your name (the author), and the institution you are affiliated with (Trinity Western University). It is also helpful if you include the date that you are submitting the assignment. Abstract: This the second page of your paper. The purpose of the abstract is for the author to convey the sentiment of the study in a concise yet informative manner. The abstract is used to determine if the reader is interested in the article and wants to retrieve the article for further information. In 250 words, the abstract explicitly states the overall problem and research question, a brief description of the method, a summary of the findings and important conclusions. Introduction: The purpose of an introduction is to inform the reader of the rationale for your research topic. It should provide a brief overview of the “problem” that you are addressing by providing a broad context, any relevant statistics and describing the importance of your topic. The introduction is also the place where you can define any important terms that may be unfamiliar to the reader and ends with establishing what the key purpose for the paper is. The purpose can be stated as your research question. Methods: The methods section outlines specifically what procedures the author chose to do. In a research report this section will include the sampling methods, sample size, measures, research design, and interventions used. The methods section of a research report looks very different than a methods section of a literature review. In a literature review, the methods section will emphasize how you chose the articles and how you evaluated the articles you reviewed. This will include describing any inclusion or exclusion criteria, the databases that were searched, what key search terms were used, how many records were obtained and how many articles were included in the review. You can refer to the APA (2019) manual for a more detailed explanation of the methods section. Results: The results section reports the findings of the data analysis of a research report or the critical analysis of a literature review. Please refer to the APA manual (2019) for extensive detail about the results of different empirical research reports. Discussion: In the discussion section, the authors describe their own interpretations of the results and link these interpretations back to the literature that was reviewed. In this section the author may discuss the strengths and limitations of the literature, draw conclusions, and make recommendations for future research on the topic. Reference List: The reference list provides a precise list of all of the sources you cited within your paper. An example of an APA style paper can be found here. 3.2.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read and Practice! 📺 To begin this learning activity, watch the following video where Dr. Strong explains what is scholarly writing. 📖 Next, read chapter 2 of the APA (2019) manual which discusses the structure and content of an APA style manuscript or paper. 📺 Next, watch the following video on formatting a student paper. This video shows you how to set up your title page and other pages in APA style in a word document. 💻 Practice your skills by creating a title page and second page in an APA formatted word document. Note, these elements will be evaluated in Assignment 2, 3, and 4. 3.3 How to Write a Scholarly Paper To begin writing a scholarly paper you need to have a research topic in mind. Then you need to do a review of scholarly literature to obtain a good working knowledge of your topic and then critically evaluate and synthesize the literature you have read. Finally, you need to have an organizational system for presenting what you know about the research topic. The APA (2019) manual provides a clear organizational structure for presenting scholarly information. When you begin writing, it is important to remember that you are communicating ideas about a topic to a specific audience. In order to convey your ideas well, you need to write clearly and concisely with set of specific guidelines. This is important for two reasons: to keep your reader’s attention and to make sure your meaning is clear. If your writing is long-winded, you will either lose the interest of your reader or confuse your reader. When your writing is more concise and clear, this will motivate your reader to pay attention to what you have to say. There are also times when you are writing with a specific purpose in mind. For example, to prepare an assignment or a board briefing document. Writing clearly and concisely helps a writer communicate what needs to be said in an efficient and effective way. It is also easy to understand and helps the writer connect with the audience. Here is an excellent resource by the Purdue Owl Writing Center on “Tips for Writing in North American Colleges”. This website is full of helpful resources to help you improve your scholarly writing. 3.3.1 Learning Activity: Read, Watch and Reflect! 📖 In this learning activity you will begin by reading chapter 4 of the APA (2019) manual which discusses writing style and grammar. 📺 Next, watch the following video where Dr. Strong discusses the key elements of scholarly writing. ✏️ Answer the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal. Make note of the elements of APA style writing that you struggle with and need to improve on for your next assignment. What resources could you use to improve your scholarly writing? Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. 3.4 Citing the Ideas of Others Within each section of a scholarly paper, each paragraph utilizes a combination three types of content: claims, evidence and transitions. Heady states that “claims are the points you want to prove, interpretations you want to offer, and assertions you want to make, whereas, evidence is the material you use to back up your claims” (pp. 74-75). Some examples of types of evidence that may be used to support claims include: “quotes from a book, citations from an article, data from a study, personal experience, historical facts, statistics, etc. Transitions are one or two words that help you move from one claim to another” (pp. 74-75). An example of the three types of content (claims, evidence and transitions) included in a paragraph of scholarly writing is provided below from the article “A Systematic Literature Review of Servant Leadership Theory in Organizational Contexts” by Parris and Peachy (2013, pp. 377-378): Over the years, some leadership scholars have called attention to the implicit connection between ethics and leadership. A burgeoning new research area and leadership theory that has been linked to ethics, virtues and morality is servant leadership (Graham 1991; Lancot and Irving 2010; Parolini et al. 2009; Russell 2001; Whetstone, 2002). Despite servant leadership being coined by Robert K. Greenleaf over three decades ago in 1970, it remains understudied yet prominently practiced in boardrooms and organizations (Bass and Bass 2008; Spears 2005). From the example above, you can see that a topic is introduced in the first sentence. A claim with supporting evidence is provided in the second sentence (with references) and the transition begins in the third sentence with the word “despite”. The third sentence also includes a claim with supporting evidence (references). This paragraph structure is typical of what you would find in scholarly writing. Scholarly writing involves putting your own thoughts and ideas (claims) in context by ensuring that you are citing the ideas of those who have influenced you (APA, 2010, p.169). Heady (2013) suggests five general rules you should always follow when you are organizing your paper (p. 80): You must provide enough background information to give your reader a good working knowledge of your topic. Your background information must lead logically to your research question. All claims/ideas/facts must be backed up by evidence. All evidence must be related to a claim/idea/fact. If evidence does not back up a claim, you need to explain why and/or account for it. 3.4.1 Learning Activity: Read, Watch and Practice! 📖 In this learning activity you will begin by reading chapter 8 of the APA manual (7th edition). 📺 Then, watch the following video where Dr. Strong discusses Academic Dishonesty. 📺 Next, watch the following video tutorial “In-text Citations, Quotations and Plagarism” by Dr. Forlenza. In the video Dr. Forlenza discusses the importance of properly citing sources in APA format. 💻 Next, practice your skills by taking the following quiz. Then, you can check your answers to the quiz here. ✏️ Then, in your learning journal you can practice citations in APA format for the following: A direct quote less than 40 words with proper in-text citation. A direct quote more than 40 words with proper in-text citation. A sentence that refers to an idea from the article (paraphrased), and provide a proper in-text citation. Note that these elements will be assessed in assignments 2, 3 and 4. Reference Lists The reference list provides a precise list of all of the sources you cited within your paper. APA (7th edition) has many rules to follow for correct formatting of references (see chapters 6 and 7). In general, the APA manual states “when in doubt, provide more information rather than less. Because one purpose of listing references is to enable readers to retrieve and use the sources…” (p.193). 3.4.2 Learning Activity: Read, Watch and Practice! 📖 In this learning activity, you will begin by reading chapter 9 of the APA manual (7th edition). 📺 Next, watch the following video tutorial “Reference Lists” by Dr. Forlenza. In the video Dr. Forlenza discusses the different elements required for, and examples of, references in APA style. 💻 Finally, practice your skills by taking this online quiz. Then, you can create a reference list in APA format for the following sources: A journal article A book or book chapter A blog post A doctoral dissertation or master’s thesis An online newspaper or news magazine article A government report Note that these elements will be assessed in assignments 2, 3 and 4. Additional APA Resources: “The APA Style Blog is the official companion to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, Sixth Edition. It’s run by a group of experts who work with APA Style every day. We publish weekly posts to talk about what we love—writing, publishing, and APA Style. We explore what APA Style is and how it works in a variety of areas, including reference citations of every sort, grammar and usage, the publication process, and social media. Occasionally we feature guest bloggers who write about more technical issues.” (APA Style Blog, 2017) “The Purdue OWL: Online Writing Lab resources will help you learn how to use the American Psychological Association (APA) citation and format style. This section contains resources on in-text citation and the References page, as well as APA sample papers, slide presentations, and the APA classroom poster.” (Purdue OWL, 2017)* 3.4.3 Learning Activity: Read and Reflect! I just want to encourage you because you have worked through a lot of very technical material in this unit. I want you to know that I expect students to make many APA mistakes in this course. I don’t expect everyone to read the APA manual, watch the tutorial videos, and be able to apply every detail automatically. What I do expect is that you try to begin applying what you have learned about APA every time you write something. You will find with every assignment that you will make APA mistakes, and that is ok. I actually find the best way to learn APA is to make mistakes, correct them, and then learn what to do right the next time. I still make mistakes and I have been working with APA style for many years. 📖 In this learning activity you will begin by reading the following article Evidence-Based Guidelines for Avoiding the Most Common APA Errors in Journal Article Submissions ✏️ Answer the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal. Discuss the elements of APA style or scholarly writing that you struggle with and how you plan to improve on these elements before you submit your next assignment. Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. Unit 3 Summary In this unit, you have learned how important it is to use APA style in graduate level writing. You have also learned how to apply the APA standards for general aspects of writing and citing sources. Unit 3 Assessment Prepare for your Discussion In your learning pod this week/discussion post, you will create a short presentation on a section of the APA manual. You can create a shared presentation using Google Slides or Google Docs. Please be creative! The instructions for this group activity are provided under the Assignment tab in Moodle. Complete Assignment #2: Literature Search The purpose of this assignment is to develop your skills to search, retrieve and review relevant literature.

To begin this unit, I want to provide you with a very brief overview of servant leadership because the research articles that I have selected for you to focus on for units 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 are all focused on the topic of servant leadership. I have included articles on servant leadership from the field of education, business, non-profit and health care. Servant leadership, as a concept, has its origins tracing back to the earliest records we have in history. It is not a religious concept, however, it is a concept that you will find is supported by most of the world’s major religions. For Christians, Jesus Christ is considered the epitome of a servant-leader. In fact servant leadership is fully aligned with the teachings of Christianity. For example, read the following passage from Mark 10:35-45 which states “But among you it will be different. Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant.” Mark 10:43 Consider the following reflection on this passage by Mark Roberts (2014). In 1970, Robert Greenleaf began writing about servant leadership in our modern day context in his seminal essay “The Servant as Leader”. He stated that “servant leadership begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve others first. Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. That person is sharply different from one who is leader first…”(p.6). Several years later Larry Spears (2010) went on to write an essay that describes the ten characteristics of a servant leader. They are: Listening Empathy Healing Awareness Persuasion Conceptualization Foresight Stewardship Commitment to the Growth of People Building Community According to Sendjaya and Sarros (2002) “There has been a strong tendency among leadership scholars and journalists to treat leaders as isolated heroes controlling and commanding others from within their ivory tower. In the organizational context, the word ‘leader’ has been mostly ascribed to people who hold management positions and are capable of giving orders to other members of the organization (Senge, 1990)”. The authors suggest that servant leadership may offer a better alternative. 4.1.0.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read and Reflect 📺 In this learning activity you will begin by watching the following video “What is Servant Leadership?” In the video Dr. Strong provides an introduction to the modern servant leadership movement. 📖 Next, read the article by Eva et al., (2019) Servant leadership: A systematic review and call for future research to familiarize yourself with the current state of research on servant leadership. ✏️ After reading the article, complete the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal. What is already known and not known about servant leadership? Why do you think servant leadership should be of interest researchers in the leadership field? Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. 4.2 What is a Research Problem? All good research begins with a good research problem. Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) suggest that research problems “are the issues, controversies or concerns that demand study” (p. 80). They assert that these are often real problems that must be addressed. Gall, Gall and Borg (2007) suggest that in identifying the research problem, the researcher should consider personal interest, the potential benefits to the researcher’s professional growth, and potential contribution of the research study to research knowledge. They suggest that all three criteria should be considered, with emphasis on the first and third. Somewhat reflexively, a thorough review of literature on a topic that interests you informs the identification of a good research problem. Gall, Gall and Borg (2007, p. 43) suggest that through the process of the literature review, researchers ask themselves the following kinds of questions. Has research on this problem been done before? What has been learned? What more can I contribute? How do my methods compare to those employed by other researchers? Are there more compelling research problems to be addressed? All of these contribute to answering the ultimate question for any research: “So what?” As a consumer of research, these sorts of questions can help you identify a good research problem to focus your personal research interest. This narrowing of research interest, or research problem, is a process that is refined as you read over a variety of different sources of literature. 4.2.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read, and Reflect! 📺 To begin this learning activity, watch the following three videos. In the first video Dr. Strong explains the sections of a scholarly paper. 📺 In the second video Dr. Strong provides an introduction to research reports. 📺 In the third video Dr. Strong answers the question: What is a research problem? 📖 Next, read chapter 3, “Statements of the Problem,” in the Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) text to help you understand what the statement of the problem is and what to look for in a high-quality article. ✏️ In your reflective learning journal, practice evaluating the quality of a study’s statement of the problem of the Eva et al., article. Use the quality criteria discussed in Table 3.1(Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015) to evaluate the quality of the statement of the problem. Finally, in your learning journal, identify what your overall quality rating is of this section and list three pieces of evidence to support your rating. Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. 4.3 What is a Literature Review? The research problem establishes why a particular research study is worth doing. The review of the literature supports this by establishing what is already known about the problem and summarizes what scholarship has already established regarding the research problem. This has many facets that go beyond merely establishing the research purpose. As we will see, a literature review affects every aspect of a research study and its final report. For that reason, one of the most important preliminary steps in the process of scholarly inquiry is doing a thorough review of the precedent academic literature on a given topic. A precedent literature review is the process of locating, obtaining, reading and evaluating the research and theoretical literature in your area of interest. Bordens and Abbott (2005) outline several important reasons for a researcher to conduct a precedent literature review: To avoid needless duplication of effort. By becoming familiar with an area of study through a review of the literature, the researcher can avoid “re-inventing the wheel.” The researcher’s specific question or topic may already have been thoroughly addressed and answered. In the case of research designed for application, a review of literature provides a rich resource of information upon which to draw and apply to the chosen context. To clarify the design of research. Designing a study involves decisions regarding which concepts or variables are most germane and how to define, measure, or describe them. The published literature provides the researcher with a rich resource of information about each of these dimensions. The researcher may also find established procedures or existing materials (e.g., a survey tool) that would inform their research. To update the researcher on the current state of knowledge in a particular field. Researchers must be up to date on current empirical or theoretical advances and controversies in a particular area. Gall, Gall &amp; Borg (2007, pp. 96-97) provide a similar but expanded list of reasons for the researcher to conduct a thorough review of precedent literature: Delimiting the research problem. Generally, it is advantageous to the researcher to investigate a limited problem in depth as opposed to doing a superficial study over a broad area. Review of precedent research will give you insight into how other researchers have focused their inquiry within a broad field. Seeking new lines of inquiry. A thorough review of precedent literature will not only reveal what has been done in a given area of interest, but will also, perhaps more importantly, reveal what has been overlooked. This is valuable information for a potential researcher and is a major driver of new research. Avoiding fruitless approaches. The cause of scholarship is not advanced by the multiplication of research studies based on the same methodological paradigm that continues to report no significant effect, and the researcher who adds to such a litany clearly demonstrates that he or she has not done an adequate review of precedent literature. As a wise and discerning consumer of research, you want to avoid wasting your time with fruitless approaches. Gaining methodological insights. Researchers can find important ideas as to how they can design their research to be more fruitful. As a wise consumer of research, you may consider looking for reports using a variety of research methods. Identifying recommendations for further research. For both the researcher and the discerning consumer of research, the section of research reports that makes recommendations for further research can be a gold mine. A precedent literature review that is useful and instructive exhibits the following features: the writer’s clarity of purpose and focus of the research question the thoroughness of the writer’s search the quality and reliability of the writer’s sources the degree to which the writer provides synthesis (i.e., relates research studies to one another and to the paper’s thesis and purpose in meaningful ways) the objectivity of the writer in selecting, interpreting, organizing and summarizing the research he or she has reviewed. 4.3.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read, and Reflect! 📺 In this learning activity, begin by watching the following video where Dr. Strong explains what a literature review is. 📖 Next, read chapter 4 “Literature Reviews” in the Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) text. ✏️ Practice evaluating the quality of a study’s literature review, using the Eva et al., article. Use the quality criteria discussed in Table 4.3 (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015) to evaluate the quality of the literature review. ✏️ Finally, in your reflective learning journal, identify what your overall quality rating is of this section and list three pieces of evidence to support your rating. Make some notes about what you would look for in a high quality “Literature Review”. Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. 4.4 What is the Research Purpose? The research problem establishes why a particular research study is worth doing or why it matters, the review of precedent literature establishes what is already known about the problem, and the research purpose establishes what the research specifically intends to do. Typically, the research purpose is further refined into a limited number of research questions or predictions (hypotheses) that the researcher will address. Taken together, these three common elements in introductions to research reports combine in such a way as to “pose significant questions that can be answered empirically” (Gall, Gall &amp; Borg, 2007, p. 35). As a consumer of research, you are vitally interested in the answers research reports offer to your significant questions. Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) contend that “specifying a study purpose may be the most important step the entire research process” (p. 162). Identification of the research problem and review of precedent literature leads directly to specifying the purpose of the study. The purpose will then provide direction for selection of the research design, data collection, analysis of data in determining findings or results and finally in the interpretation and evaluation of the research. 4.4.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read and Reflect! 📺 Begin this learning activity by watching the following video where Dr. Strong explains what is the research purpose. 📖 Next, read chapter 5, “Purpose Statements and Research Questions,” in the Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) text. ✏️ Practice evaluating the quality of a study’s purpose statement/research question, using the Eva et al., article. Use the criteria discussed in Table 5.7 (Quantitative) or Table 5.8 (Qualitative) (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015) to evaluate the quality of the research question/purpose statement. ✏️ Finally, in your reflective learning journal, identify what your overall quality rating is of this section and list three pieces of evidence to support your rating. Make some notes about what you would look for in a high quality “Purpose Statement and/or Research Question”. Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. Unit 4 Summary In this unit you have learned about the origin and development of servant leadership and the common elements found in the introduction of research reports. You have learned about the research problem, the review of precedent literature, and the research purpose and the similarities and differences among qualitative and quantitative research reports. Although theses terms are similar, they are quite different and serve different functions in the introduction of a research report. Unit 4 Assessment Prepare for your Discussion In your learning pod/discussion post this week, you will read the introduction section of Eva et al., (2019) Servant leadership: A systematic review and call for future research. While you read the introduction, you will evaluate it using the criteria provided in the Plano-Clark and Creswell text: for the statement of the problem, the literature review, and the research question/purpose. You will prepare a short summary of your evaluation and post it on the Unit 4 forum. Remember to provide the title of your article in your summary. Checking Your Learning Now that you have completed the learning activities and assignments for this unit, check the list below to see if you can do the following: Can you compare and contrast the common elements of a quantitative research question and a qualitative research question. Can you evaluate the quality of the research problem, literature review, and purpose statement of a research report on servant leadership.

E-Resources: The articles in this unit can be found through the TWU library. 5.1 Introduction to Quantitative and Qualitative Research Design In this unit we will explore the next major section of a research report: The methods and results section. We will see that the methods section indicates the overall plan for how the research was conducted, how the data was collected, and what the analysis of the data tells us. These may be termed research design, method, and analysis and results, respectively. In unit 5 we will be looking at the methods and results sections of quantitative research reports. Once again we start with the reminder that we are reviewing these materials in order to become an informed consumer of research, rather than research experts. Before we get into the specifics of the methods and results of quantitative research reports, it would be helpful to take a step back and remind ourselves of some of the features of the broader research landscape. By now you should be familiar with the terms quantitative research and qualitative research. Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) assert that these research approaches are suited to different kinds of research questions: a quantitative research approach is indicated when the research problem requires explanation, while a qualitative research approach is indicated when the research problem requires exploration (p. 85). Expanding on that somewhat, Leedy and Ormrod assert that quantitative research has three purposes: to explain and predict, to confirm and validate, and to test theory. In contrast, qualitative research has three distinct purposes: to describe and explain, to explore and interpret, and to build theory (Leedy &amp; Ormrod, 2010, p. 96). These differing research purposes find expression in differing research processes, the kinds of data gathered, the approaches to data analysis, and finally in the ways findings are communicated. In this unit we will be looking at the methods and results sections of quantitative research reports, and in unit 6 we will do the same for qualitative research reports. We will see that there are a variety of different research designs under both of these general approaches. For example, Gill and Johnson (2002) have developed a helpful continuum (see the figure below) that describes the relative emphasis of various research designs on selected characteristics. They argue that quantitative designs (including survey research) tend towards deduction while qualitative designs are inductive in nature. Figure 5.1: Gill and Johnson’s continuum of research design emphases According to Leedy and Ormrod, the nature of quantitative and qualitative research designs differ (2010, p. 96). Quantitative designs tend to be more closely focused on a problem that has known variables that can be controlled or at least accounted for. The investigation is conducted following established guidelines utilizing largely predetermined methods while the researcher seeks to maintain a detached view. In contrast, qualitative designs tend to be more holistic, investigating unknown variables following flexible guidelines utilizing emergent methods in a highly context-bound, personal approach. Qualitative designs may be characterized as evolving and flexible, sometimes guided by a general hunch as to how to proceed (Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007, p. 45). These differing designs lead to marked differences in what data are collected, how data are collected, and how data are analyzed. Quantitative research seeks to collect numeric data from as large a sample as possible so to enhance claims to being representative, using standardized data collection instruments. Qualitative research gathers textual or image-based data from typically small, informative samples using loosely structured or non-standardized interviews or observations (Leedy &amp; Ormrod, 2010, p. 96). The differing designs of quantitative and qualitative research also lead to marked differences in how data are analyzed. Quantitative data is approached primarily through deductive reasoning, employing statistical analyses applied to numerical data, with stress on objectivity. Qualitative data is approached primarily through inductive reasoning with the goal being to uncover themes and categories, with acknowledgement of potential researcher bias and subjectivity. Typically, quantitative research findings are reported in a formal, scientific style with full display of numbers and statistics, while qualitative research findings are typically reported in a narrative form (Leedy &amp; Ormrod, 2010, p. 96). In the following sections, we will explore this somewhat for quantitative research. 5.1.1 Learning Activity: Watch and Reflect 📺 To begin this learning activity, watch the following video Qualitative &amp; Quantitative Research - An Introduction. 📖 Next, read the article by Van Dierendonck et al., (2014). Same difference? Exploring the differential mechanisms linking servant leadership and transformational leadership to follower outcomes. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2013.11.014 to prepare yourself for the group activity in this unit. ✏️ After reading the article, complete the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal. Discuss the differences between qualitative and quantitative research reports. What did you learn from this article that you did not already know about servant leadership? What are the potential challenges for studying servant leadership using a quantitative research approach? Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. 5.2 Quantitative Research Designs Quantitative research designs typically rely on the researcher beginning with a theoretical (or conceptual) framework that will determine what concepts the researcher chooses to investigate, the research questions, and the framing of research findings (Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008, p. 39). These frameworks lead to a structured, predetermined, formal, and specifically detailed plan of operation (Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007, p. 45). In Chapter 6, Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) discuss five quantitative research designs: true experiments, quasi-experiment, single-subject, correlational, and survey research designs. Experiments—particularly randomized control trials (RCTs)—are often held up as the “gold standard” of research, meeting the criteria of randomization, control, and manipulation of variables (i.e., experimental procedures, treatments, or interventions). In the domain of knowledge transfer and evidence-based practice, RCTs are considered as the highest level or most reliable form of evidence. For further understanding see the following video by David Schwartz “Not All Scientific Studies are Created Equal”. By way of caution, Gill and Johnson (2002) observe that management and leadership research seldom employs true experimentation. They posit that this is because true experiments are difficult to conduct in natural everyday settings, due to the difficulty of maintaining the tight controls required for experimental research. Having said this, there is relevance for us because the logic underpinning experimental research applies to other types of deductive research that are more common in management and leadership research. When not all of the rigorous standards required of experiments can be applied to a study, researchers approximate some of the logic of the experiment with quasi-experimental designs. In true experimental and quasi-experimental designs, the researcher intentionally introduces an intervention, and then seeks to measure the response to that intervention. The main difference between experimental and quasi-experimental designs lies in the way sampling is done. In non-experimental quantitative research designs, the researcher seeks to understand the behavior or attributes of the study sample without any researcher intervention. The terms descriptive and correlational are often applied to these types of quantitative research designs. As a consumer of research reports, you can usually find an indication of what research methodology is employed in the abstract of a research study. This is important information for you to identify, as you will quickly develop a sense of what to expect as you continue to read. This sense is important as you critique the research report, and make value judgments as to its worth. A Note About Survey Research At this point we want to focus on survey research for a few moments because of its wide use in leadership and management settings. While the survey is a method of data collection that may be used in qualitative research (Gall, Gall &amp; Borg, 2007, p. 227), it is extensively employed in quantitative research (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 207). Be aware of ambiguities in how the term survey is used (see “Here’s a Tip!” on page 207). Often the term is used as a general label to denote the use of questionnaires or interviews in research. Because of the differences in intentions for generalizability between quantitative and qualitative research, this ambiguity is not helpful. Plano-Clark and Creswell see survey research as a form of quantitative research, sitting near the end of that continuum (2015, p. 197). Survey research is a popular research method used to generalize from a sample to a population in order that inferences can be made about some characteristic, attitude, or behavior of the larger population (Creswell, 2003). Survey research may be conducted through use of either questionnaires or interviews. These methods allow the researcher to collect data about observable phenomena as well as phenomena that would be difficult to otherwise assess (i.e., opinions, values, feelings, etc.). Questionnaires present the same questions in some form of print to all study participants uniformly, and responses are received in like manner. In interviews, the researcher presents the same questions orally to study participants, usually one at a time, but increasingly in groups, and the responses are received orally. The main difference in the two approaches lies in the fact that with questionnaires the research participant is largely in control of the response situation, whereas in the interview the researcher is largely in control. Each approach has relative advantages and disadvantages, but share in common the desire to collect data in standardized ways. For this reason, closed ended questions are typically used, and in questionnaires, often with forced responses (i.e., select a number on a Likert scale). As a consumer of survey research reports, be vigilant for potential issues of validity and reliability. Validity is a term that forces us to question the likelihood of whether the instrument or study measure actually measures what the researcher says it does. Reliability issues concern the consistency or repeatability of the instrument. Be aware that survey research is commonly criticized on these grounds, a fact underscored in Plano-Clark and Creswell’s suggestion to remedy possible concerns for internal validity by choosing a quantitative research design other than survey (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 247). 5.2.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read, and Reflect 📺 Begin this learning activity by watching the following video where Dr. Strong provides an introduction to Quantitative Research Designs. (Note: This video is 45 minutes long) 📖 Next, read chapter 6, “Quantitative Research Designs,” in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015). ✏️ Practice evaluating the quality of a study’s research design, using the Van Dierendonck et al., article. Use the quality criteria discussed in Table 6.3 (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015) to evaluate the quality of the research design. ✏️ Finally, in your learning journal, identify what your overall quality rating is of this section and list three pieces of evidence to support your rating. Make some notes about what you would look for in a high quality “Research Design” for a quantitative research report. Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. 5.3 Quantitative Data Collection When researchers are collecting data for a quantitative research study, they need to address two important questions: who is the data being collected from, and how are they collecting it? In answering the first question, the terms population and sample are salient. Population is the large category that encompasses all of the individuals who possess or exhibit certain characteristics of interest. Quantitative data is usually collected from large samples, selected ideally through random selection. Sample refers to the individuals from the population that you actually gather data from. The goal in sampling is to find a representative sample that accurately represents that population. In quantitative research, a primary interest of researchers is in generalizability: which is to what degree can the results of our research study be generalized back to the population? This generalization is called external validity and requires an inferential leap from the sample back to the population. In quantitative research, samples are drawn from the population through processes of probability sampling and non-probability sampling techniques. A number of sampling techniques are discussed by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) in Chapter 7. The gold standard is a true random sample of the population. This is where everyone gets an equal opportunity to be selected as a representative sample, and this is known as probability sampling. The second major consideration in qualitative data collection is how the data is collected. In quantitative research, data collection instruments and tools are used most often to capture variables of interest. This may include using inventories, questionnaires, indexes, scales and test scores (Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007, p. 46). As a consumer of research, when judging the quality of tests used in research consider the criteria of fairness, generalizability, cognitive complexity, content quality, meaningfulness, content coverage and cost and efficiency (p. 217). A variable is anything that can vary, i.e. changed or be changed, such as eating behaviour or time taken to perform a task. There are three types of variables that are usually found in experimental investigations: the dependent variable (or outcome), the independent variable (treatment/predictor) and counfounding variable (extraneous factors that could affect the results) . In an experiment, the researcher is looking for the possible effect on the dependent variable that might be caused by changing the independent variable, while controlling for extraneous variables (Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007, p. 45). These are all variables, which are not the independent variable, but could affect the results of the experiment. What is Research Ethics? According to Walton (n.d.), “research that involves human participants raises unique and complex ethical, legal, social and political issues. There are three objectives in research ethics. The first and broadest objective is to protect human participants. The second objective is to ensure that research is conducted in a way that serves interests of individuals, groups and/or society as a whole. Finally, the third objective is to examine specific research activities and projects for their ethical soundness, looking at issues such as the management of risk, protection of confidentiality and the process of informed consent”. Before a researcher can start collecting information from participants, the research proposal must undergoe ethical review. In Canada, all academic institutions and health authorities have a Research Ethics Board (REB) and in the U.S. the same institutions have Institutional Review Boards (IRB) that conduct the reviews. The purpose of the ethical review process is to “ensure that research is planned and conducted in accordance with laws and regulatory standards. In protecting the rights and welfare of participants, REBs must weigh possible harms to individuals against the plausible societal benefits of the research. They must ensure fair participant selection and, where applicable, confirm that appropriate provisions are in place for obtaining participant consent” (Page &amp; Nyeboer, 2017, para. 2). What is Informed Consent? by USC OPRS Informed Consent is a voluntary agreement to participate in research. It is not merely a form that is signed but is a process, in which the participant has an understanding of the research and its risks. Informed consent is essential before enrolling a participant and ongoing once enrolled. Informed Consent must be obtained for all types of human research including; diagnostic, therapeutic, interventional, social and behavioral studies, and for research conducted domestically or abroad. Obtaining consent involves informing the participant about his or her rights, the purpose of the study, the procedures to be undergone, and the potential risks and benefits of participation. Participants in the study must participate willingly. Vulnerable populations (i.e. prisoners, children, pregnant women, etc.) must receive extra protections. The goal of the informed consent process is to provide sufficient information so that a participant can make an informed decision about whether or not to enroll in a study or to continue participation. 5.3.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read, and Reflect 📺 Begin this learning activity by watching the following video where Dr. Strong explains data collection methods in quantitative research. 📖 Next, read chapter 7, “Participants and Data Collection,” in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015). ✏️ Practice evaluating the quality of a quantitative study’s participants and data collection, using the Van Dierendonck et al., article. Use the quality criteria discussed in Table 7.2 (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015) to evaluate the quality of the participants and data collection. ✏️ Finally, in your learning journal, identify what your overall quality rating is of this section and list three pieces of evidence to support your rating. Make some notes about what you would look for in a high quality “Participants and Data Collection” section of a quantitative research report. Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. 5.4 Quantitative Data Analysis and Results Quantitative research data analysis is generally deductive, occurs at the conclusion of data collection and is statistical (Bogdan and Biklen, 2007, p. 46). An in-depth understanding or even an overview of statistical analysis is outside the parameters of this course. However, even if you do not have a background in statistics, you must find your way through what can initially appear to be a daunting discussion. The methods section of a quantitative research report typically presents a brief description of various statistical analysis of data. The statistical analysis chosen depends on the kind of questions asked in the research. Descriptive statistics include various measures of central tendency (including mean, median, mode, skewness, and categorical data such as frequency distribution), measures of variability (including standard deviation, the normal curve, variance and range) and correlational statistics (including bivariate and multivariate correlational methods). Table 8.1 on page 260 of Plano-Clark and Creswell is a useful summary of descriptive statistics terminology, use, and examples. Inferential statistics are applied to data in an effort to answer comparison and relationship sorts of questions. A useful chart showing some common inferential statistics are found in Tables 8.2 and 8.3 on pages 266 and 267 of Plano-Clark and Creswell. As a consumer of qualitative research reports, you will want to know that the statistics employed are appropriate, and to be cautious about accepting research findings if you detect any inconsistencies. Additional Resources I wanted to provide you with a few extra resources to help you understand Quantitative Analysis and Results. Here is a link to a really helpful website that has been created by Dr. Andy Field. Dr. Field goes into much more detail about everything you need to know about statistics than the course textbook. Here is the website: https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/ If there is something that you don’t understand when you are reading through the results section of a quantitative research study, search Dr. Field’s website. 5.4.1 Learning Activity: Read, Evaluate and Reflect 📺 Begin this learning activity by watching the following video where Dr. Strong explains Quantitative Data Analysis. 📖 Next, read chapter 8, “Data Analysis and Results,” in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015). ✏️ Practice evaluating the quality of a quantitative study’s analysis and results, using the Van Dierendonck et al., article. Use the quality criteria discussed in Table 8.4 (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015) to evaluate the quality of the data analysis and results. ✏️ In your learning journal, identify what your overall quality rating is of this section and list three pieces of evidence to support your rating. Make some notes about what you would look for in a high quality “Analysis and Results” section of a quantitative research report. Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. Unit 5 Summary In Unit 5 we have explored quantitative research methods. We have learned that the methods section indicates the overall plan for how the research was conducted, how the data was collected, and what the analysis of the data tells us. These sections of a research report are called the research design, method, and analysis and results, respectively. Coming up in unit 6 we will be looking at the methods and results sections of qualitative research reports. Unit 5 Assessment Prepare for your Discussion In your learning pod/discussion post, you will read the Methods and Results section of one of the quantitative servant leadership articles. While you read the methods and results section, you will evaluate these sections using the criteria provided in the Plano-Clark and Creswell text for the research design, participants and data collection, and results. You will prepare a short summary of your evaluation and post it on the Unit 5 forum. Remember to provide the title of your article in your summary.

E-Resources: The articles in this unit can be found through the TWU library. 6.1 Qualitative Research Design This week in Unit 6 you will be exploring a different approach to research: qualitative research methods. Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) define qualitative research as “a set of procedures for collecting, analyzing, and reporting text and image data to answer research questions by exploring participants’ views” (p. 286). Qualitative research has three distinct purposes: to describe, to explore, and to build theory. Quantitative research and qualitative research designs differ significantly in what data are collected, how data are collected, how data are analyzed and how findings are reported. As someone who was trained as a quantitative researcher, I would sometimes hear people in my discipline discredit the qualitative approach to research. However, as qualitative research has become more mainstream over the last 20 years, now I would say the most widely held opinion is that there is no best method. “It all depends on what you are studying and what you want to find out” (Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007, p. 43). I can certainly appreciate understanding a problem or a phenomenon from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective. For example, in order to understand the complexity and “messiness” of real-life organizations, it is important for leaders to not just rely only on statistics, but to also examine what employees, consumers, and leaders have to say from a qualitative perspective. It is really important that you read through the textbook chapters on quantitative (chapters 6, 7, 8) and qualitative research (9, 10, 11) so that you can understand the distinct differences in the two approaches to research. Qualitative research has been “mainstreamed” in recent years, although in certain disciplines its use is not as widespread. In order to understand the complexity and “messiness” of real-life organizations, leadership investigation is turning increasingly to qualitative research. Qualitative research designs typically are less structured than in quantitative designs, and are far more flexible. In contrast to quantitative research design’s resting solidly on theoretical frameworks, in qualitative research design the use of theoretical frameworks is not nearly so clear. While some qualitative researchers do employ theoretical frameworks, at least to some degree, others, such as Corbin and Strauss “prefer not to begin our research with a predefined theoretical framework or set of concepts” (Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008, p. 39). Consequently, qualitative research design has been characterized as an “evolving, flexible, general hunch as to how you might proceed” (Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007, p. 45). Theoretical frameworks are employed in qualitative research design to suggest alternate explanations, to help the researcher determine appropriate methodology, and to provide the basis for building and extending theory. The primary consideration for the qualitative researcher is that they remain “open” to new ideas and concepts that might not fit the concepts of the adopted theoretical framework (Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008, p. 40). Part Four of your reading of the course text (Plano-Clark and Creswell, 2015) focuses on four qualitative methods: narrative, grounded theory, case study, and ethnographic research designs. 6.1.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read, and Reflect 📺 Begin this learning activity by watching the following video where Dr. Strong explains Qualitative Research Designs. 📖 Next, read chapter 9, “Qualitative Research Designs,” in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015). 📖 Then, read the article by Ragnarsson, Kristjánsdóttir, &amp; Gunnarsdóttir (2018). To Be Accountable While Showing Care: The Lived Experience of People in a Servant Leadership Organization prepare yourself for the group activity in this unit. ✏️ After reading the article, reflect on the following questions in your learning journal: What did you learn from this article that you did not already know about servant leadership? What are the potential challenges for studying servant leadership using a qualitative research approach? Make some notes about what you would look for in a high quality “Qualitative Research Design”. Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. 6.2 Qualitative Data Collection Qualitative research data collection is typically based on one or more of the following methods: observation (including participant observation), open-ended interviewing, first person accounts, and the review of various documents. Data collected is descriptive, and may consist of personal documents, field notes, various records of people’s own words (including video and voice recordings and written transcripts), photographs, official documents, and other artifacts. Data is collected from small, non-representative samples selected through various sampling strategies including theoretical, purposeful, and snow ball sampling (Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007, p. 45). A dominant word encountered in qualitative research is triangulation. Triangulation is a term borrowed from navigation and surveying, and conveys the notion that multiple sources of information will help establish a fact (Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007, p. 115). Multiple sources of data are seen to lead to a fuller, more complete, and more defensible understanding of the phenomena observed. Consequently, multiple methods of data collection are frequently employed within the same qualitative research study. These commonly consist of the researcher’s field notes, interviews, researcher observations, and analysis of various documents. In qualitative research, data is usually collected until saturation is achieved. Saturation is a term employed that simply means that no new information relevant to the development of categories, properties, dimensions and variances is forthcoming from continued data gathering (Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008, p. 143). In effect, findings begin to replicate, and not add anything substantially new (Gall, Gall &amp; Borg, 2007, p. 278). Qualitative researchers oft 6.2.1 Learning Activity: Read, Evaluate and Reflect 📺 Begin this learning activity by watching the following video, where Dr. Strong explains “Qualitative Data Collection”. 📖 Next, read chapter 10, “Participants and Data Collection,” in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015). ✏️ Practice evaluating the participants and data collection of the Ragnarsoson et al., article. Use the quality criteria discussed in Table 10.3 (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015) to evaluate the quality of the participants and data collection. ✏️ Finally, in your learning journal, identify what your overall quality rating is of this section and list three pieces of evidence to support your rating. Make some notes about what you would look for in a high quality qualitative research report. Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. 6.3 Qualitative Data Analysis and Findings Qualitative research data analysis typically employs analytic induction, is ongoing throughout the research, and seeks to identify themes and concepts emergent in the data (Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007, p. 46). This is a dynamic process in which the researcher breaks data apart into its various components in order to identify their properties and dimensions (Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008, p. 46). Because data might suggest more than one story, analysis is an interpretive act that often begins, as in Glaser and Strauss’ constant comparison, from the very onset of data collection (Gall, Gall &amp; Borg, 2007, p. 469). Data analysis involves “working with the data, organizing them, breaking them into manageable units, coding them, synthesizing them, and searching for patterns” (Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007, p. 159). Analysis involves data interpretation where ideas about the findings are related to broader concerns and concepts. Levels of analysis can range from the superficial description to theoretical interpretation (Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008, p. 80). The task is monumental. Software such as HyperRESEARCH© is of great assistance in helping the researcher assign codes to text data, which assists in the identification of concepts and themes. Qualitative research findings or results are usually presented in a narrative form. This can take many forms, and be organized in a variety of ways including the use of tables and figures when appropriate. Chapter 11 of the course text provides a concise discussion of this topic. Because qualitative research can involve the investigation of as few as one research participant (as in a case study), great caution is exercised in making sweeping generalizations. In fact, because the term generalizability itself is strongly associated with quantitative research with much larger samples, Gall, Gall and Borg suggest the term applicability is more appropriate to the different processes and types of evidence associated with qualitative research (2008, p. 477). 6.3.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read, and Reflect 📺 Begin this learning activity, by watching the following video where Dr. Strong explains “Qualitative Data Analysis”. 📖 Next, read chapter 11, “Data Analysis and Findings,” in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015). ✏️Practice evaluating the data analysis and findings of the Ragnarsoson et al., article. Use the quality criteria discussed in Table 11.3 (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015) to evaluate the quality of the data analysis and findings. ✏️ Finally, in your learning journal, identify what your overall quality rating is of this section and list three pieces of evidence to support your rating. Make some notes about what you would look for in the results section of a high quality qualitative research report. Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. Unit 6 Summary In this unit you have learned that qualitative research has three distinct purposes: to describe, to explore, and to build theory. Qualitative research designs typically are less structured than in quantitative designs, and are far more flexible. The data are usually collected from a few cases or individuals so findings cannot be generalized to a larger population, but issues can be examined in great detail. Findings can however be transferable to another setting. Unit 6 Assessment Prepare for your Discussion In your learning pod/discussion post this week, you will read the Methods and Findings section of one of the qualitative SL articles. While you read the methods and findings sections, you will evaluate these sections using the criteria provided in the Plano-Clark and Creswell text for the research design, participants and data collection, and findings. You will prepare a short summary of your evaluation and post it on the Unit 6 forum. Remember to provide the title of your article in your summary.

Understanding research: A consumer’s guide (2nd ed.). Boston, MA: Pearson. E-Resources: The articles in this unit can be found through the TWU library. 7.1 Introduction to Mixed-Methods Research This week, in Unit 7, I have prepared an audio message to introduce you to mixed methods research. You can listen to my audio message below. hstrong · Welcome to Unit 7 (2) 7.1.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read, and Reflect 📺 Begin this learning activity by watching the following video where Dr. Strong explains what mixed methods research is. In this video Dr. Strong explains how the use of both qualitative and quantitative research methods can provide a more complete picture. 📖 Next, read chapter 12, “Mixed Methods Research Designs,” in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015). ✏️ Finally, in your reflective learning journal, discuss the following question: What are some of the strengths and challenges of using a mixed-methods approach? What would you would look for in a high quality mixed-methods research report? Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. 7.2 Mixed-Methods Research Designs A wide variety of mixed methods research designs have been used by researchers. It is common in mixed methods designs to see the researchers count (quantify) certain kinds of qualitative data. As well, you will encounter quantitative researchers reporting how their research participants perceived or were emotionally impacted (i.e. qualitative data) by the experimental treatment (Leedy &amp; Ormrod, 2013, p. 97). As you look at mixed methods designs, notice how the following considerations help to differentiate the four variations of mixed methods that Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) distinguish: What is the purpose of needing qualitative and quantitative data? What is the sequence of qualitative and quantitative data collection? What is the priority of the qualitative and quantitative data? How do the two data sets inform each other? For example in a convergent parallel design, only one data collection phase is used, during which quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis are conducted separately yet concurrently. This design is used to develop a more complete understanding of a topic or phenomenon. In an embedded (concurrent nested) design, only one data collection phase is used, during which a predominant method (quantitative or qualitative) nests or embeds the other less priority method (qualitative or quantitative, respectively). This design is used o gain broader and in-depth perspectives on a topic. The sequential explanatory design involves the collection and analysis of quantitative data followed by the collection and analysis of qualitative data. This design is used to help explain, interpret or contextualize quantitative findings. The sequential exploratory design involves the collection and analysis of qualitative data followed by quantitative data collection and analysis. This designed is used to explore a phenomenon and to expand on qualitative findings. 7.2.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read, and Reflect 📺 Begin this learning activity by watching the following video where Dr. Strong explains Mixed-Methods research designs. 📖 Next, read the article by Beck (2014). Antecedents of servant leadership: A mixed methods study to prepare yourself for the group activity in this unit. ✏️ After reading the article, reflect on the following questions in your learning journal: What type of mixed-methods design was used in the article? Do you think mixed-methods research can provide a more complete picture for research on servant leadership? Why or why not? Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. 7.3 Using Mixed-Methods to Understand Leadership. Mixed methods studies have the potential to provide strengths that offset the weaknesses of both quantitative and qualitative research and provide a more complete and comprehensive understanding of the research problem than either quantitative or qualitative approaches alone. Molina-Azorín and Cameron (2015) have highlighted four ways that mixed methods research can benefit business research and this can be applied to leadership studies. For example mixed methods can be beneficial for leadership studies because: Collecting qualitative data can provide a deeper understanding of the leadership context. Attention to both process and outcome through the use of mixed methods can aid in building theory. For example qualitative findings can provide insight into what mechanisms contribute to a measured outcome. Complex organizations with different leadership roles would benefit from analyses that are integrated across micro and macro levels. The use of mixed methods can help bridge the academic-practitioner divide through enhancing the interpretation of results. For example, mixed methods can helps to explain findings or describe how causal processes work. 7.3.1 Learning Activity: Reflect ✏️ Begin this learning activity by writing a response to the following questions in your reflective learning journal: Do you think mixed-methods is the best approach for research on leadership? Why or why not? How would you use a mixed methods approach to study servant leadership? Note that these questions relate to the assignment questions for this unit. See Assessment for more details. Unit 7 Summary In general researchers conduct mixed methods studies when both quantitative and qualitative data together provide a better understanding of the research problem. The use of mixed method research provides a number of advantages, namely: Provides strengths that offset the weaknesses of both quantitative and qualitative research. Provides a more complete and comprehensive understanding of the research problem than either quantitative or qualitative approaches alone. Provides an approach for developing better, more context specific instruments. Helps to explain findings or how causal processes work. Unit 7 Assessment Prepare for your Discussion In your learning pod/discussion post this week, you will read one of the Mixed-Methods SL articles provided in this unit. While you read the article, you will evaluate the article using the criteria provided in the Plano-Clark and Creswell text for mixed-methods research reports. You will prepare a short 1-page summary of your evaluation and post it on the Unit 7 forum. Remember to provide the title of your article in your summary. Complete Assignment #3: Scholarly Article Review This assignment is the next step in moving toward a literature review paper. Remember, your eventual task is to create a literature review that is synthesized from the individual research articles you have read and have taken notes on in Assignment 3. Part of that process involves the need to be able to look back at your notes and quickly see what you actually noted from these articles. For this assignment you will write a review of a journal article using the guidelines provided under the Assignment 3: Scholarly Article Review tab. Checking Your Learning Now that you have completed the learning activities and assignments for this unit, check the list below to see if you can do the following: Can you discuss how mixed-methods research can help advance leadership research? Can you evaluate the quality of mixed methods research report on servant leadership? Can you discuss how a mixed-methods approach can be applied to the study of servant leadership?

Retrieved from http://www.spencerauthor.com/how-action-research-sparks-innovation-and-boosts-creativity-in-the-classroom/ 8.1 What is Action Research? This week in Unit 8 you will get a chance to explore a new approach to research. Action research “is a disciplined process of inquiry conducted by and for those taking the action” (Sagor, 2000, para. 1). Its purpose is to solve local/practical problems through the application of systematic investigation. The problem is local, the investigation is local, and there is little concern for generalizing results to other settings. Action research may employ virtually any research methodology, and will commonly be conducted collaboratively with other professionals. Action research differs from more formal research in some important ways that you will uncover in the readings this week. Action research has been defined as “a form of applied research whose primary purpose is to increase the quality, impact, and justice” of professional practice (Gall, Gall &amp; Borg, 2007, p. 597). Its purpose is to solve local problems through the application of systematic investigation. The problem is local, the investigation is local, and there is little concern for generalizing results to other settings. Gay (1987) states “the primary goal of action research is the solution of a given problem, not contribution to science” (p. 8). Action research may employ virtually any research methodology, and will commonly be conducted collaboratively with other professionals. Action research differs from more formal research in some important ways. Formal research is typically conducted by researchers with a great deal of experience and/or training in research, and who wish to produce new, generalizable knowledge. Action research is typically conducted by those with much less experience in and knowledge of research, with the intention of solving a current, local problem. Formal research typically employs random or representative sampling techniques, while action research will typically employ convenience sampling. Formal research designs typically exhibit rigorous controls, with a long time frame, while action research designs display more casual procedures, often employing emergent designs, and are focused on short-term time frames (Gall, Gall &amp; Borg 2007, p. 598). Action research can serve personal, professional, and political purposes. At its heart, action research is cyclical in nature. Gill and Johnson (2002) assert that action research is a planned intervention by a researcher, or more often a consultant, into some natural social setting, such as an organization. The effects of that intervention are then monitored and evaluated with the aim of discerning whether or not that action has produced the expected consequences. In other words, the researcher acts upon his or her beliefs or theories in order to change the organization (Gill &amp; Johnson, 2002, p. 71). Going back to Boyer’s model of scholarship, what distinguishes action research as research or scholarly inquiry (i.e., as more than problem-solving) is the explicit commitment to contribute to existing knowledge, even if it is not widely generalizable. According to Mutimbi and Khaila (2011): A standard research methods course at university emphasizes scientific ways of conducting research. Students are taught scientific methods of collecting data, analyzing it and reporting. They collect data and analyse it in ways that enable them to describe situations as they exist, and they come up with long ‘wish lists’ in the form of recommendations for others to implement. They become experts in analyzing and developing models to describe situations – but they cannot change the situations. In other words, they are taught to describe problems, but not to solve them. These methods are not suitable for workers who are grappling with real life issues and are looking for ways of helping solve their problems. They need research approaches and methods that enable them to generate data that they can use to solve problems. (p. 27) 8.1.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read and Reflect 📺 Begin this learning activity by watching the following video where Dr. Strong explains what action research is. 📖 Next, read chapter 13, “Action Research Designs,” in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015). 📖 You can review the following research articles to give you an idea of different action research projects - but these articles are not required readings. The articles can be found through the TWU library. Bhatnagar, V. (2017). Systemic Development of Leadership: Action Research in an Indian Manufacturing Organization.

Fostering Teachers’ Experiences of Well-Being: A Participatory Action Learning and Action Research Approach. South African Journal of Education, 39(1). ✏️ In your reflective learning journal, answer the following questions: What are some of the strengths and challenges of using an action research approach? What would you would look for in a high quality action research report? Note that your journal is not graded. These questions relate to the assessment questions for this unit. 8.2 The Action Research Method The method of action research presented by Gill and Johnson (2002) draws on Lewin’s theory of studying things through changing them (i.e., change as the method or process of research). Stringer and Genat (2004) outline a research process that has action as final step, after eliciting stakeholder perspectives, analyzing data (identifying key features of stakeholder experience), and writing the research report (i.e., change as the outcome of research). Stringer and Genat also emphasize the participatory process of action research in which change is brought about through the participants in the research project, rather than being imposed on them from the outside. They explain that a major purpose of participatory approaches to inquiry is to bring people together in a dialogic and productive relationship, enabling the development of a sense of community through the sharing of perspectives, the negotiation of meaning, and the development of collaboratively produced activities, programs, and projects (Stringer &amp; Genat, 2004, p. 9). Glanz (1998) has suggested that an action research cycle consists of six steps, which may or may not be always addressed in order. The usual first step is to select a focus. This is typically followed by data collection, then the analysis and interpretation of the data. The analysis and interpretation of data typically would suggest action to be taken. Action is followed by a period of reflection on the results of the action, and on the basis of this reflection, the action is either continued or modified. The cycle then comes full circle to begin with a new focus (p. 27). 8.2.1 Learning Activity: Watch and Create 📺 To begin this learning activity, watch the following video where Dr. Strong explains how to create an action research project. 🤔 Next, think about some practical problems that you have faced in your professional life that you would like to change. ✏️ In your reflective learning journal, list three problems that matter to you and that you think you can systematically address in your work situation. After reflecting on these problems, select one that you would like to address for your action research project. Note: The following learning activity will be created in groups during class time. For asynchronous learners, your action research presentation may be completed individually. 📺 In this learning activity, you will create an idea for an action research project based on one of the practical problems you have identified from your professional life. You will present this project idea in a podcast or video for your colleagues. This learning activity is intended to be informal, so do not spend too much time planning and researching your topic. Please note that if you are sharing confidential information from your place of employment that you should change the name of your employer or any people involved. Instructions: Using one of the practical problems you identified above, create an idea for an action research project following the steps described by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) on pp. 440-442. Put a presentation together and record your presentation so that it can be presented to your colleagues for feedback. Your introduction should include your key problem and explain the structure of your presentation. Your project idea should relate to a practical leadership issue you are currently facing. Your project idea should be clear and well organized. Your project should fit within 3-5 minutes but no more than 6 minutes (8 slides maximum). Provide a conclusion that gives a call to action. Upload your presentation to another suitable online platform and post a link to your presentation on the Unit 8 discussion forum. Reminder: Make sure you take some time to practice what you are going to say (I highly recommend creating a script) and give yourself lots of time to record, make mistakes, re-record, make more mistakes, take a break, re-record and then post it on the discussion forum. Note this learning activity is ungraded. 8.3 Evaluating An Action Research Study According to Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015): Action research has gained support across many disciplines including education, nursing, and clinical work. [However], some view it as an “informal” process of research, conducted by practitioners who are not formal academic researchers. Action researchers typically report results of their studies in informal venues, such as conferences, websites, or local groups in the community. Hence, the design may not have the rigor and systematic approach found in other designs. However, it is precisely this flexibility and responsiveness that makes action research studies among the best source of information to learn about potential solutions to real problems because they are conducted in real professional settings by real practitioners. Therefore, when evaluating an action research study, you need to keep in mind the intent and standards for this particular form of research. (pp.443-444) 8.3.1 Learning Activity: Peer-review an Action Research Project Next, you will peer review one Action Research project by colleagues in the class. Note: You will not be able to do this until everyone has posted their presentations in the Unit 8 forum. I have posted the peer-review partnerships in Moodle under the assignments tab. This means that you will be assigned to peer-review one of your colleagues presentations. For your peer-review make notes about the strengths of the project idea as well as areas to work on (clarify, more analysis, more personal application) by using the evaluation criteria for an action research study outlined by Plano-Clark and Creswell. Here are the questions you should address in your evaluation: Does the project focus on a real problem in practice? Does the researcher plan to study his or her own practices or plan to collaborate with community members? Does the project include careful reflection about the problem? Does the researcher plan to gather several sources of information (e.g., qualitative and quantitative procedures)? Does the researcher develop a clear plan for addressing the problem? Does the project include reflecting, thinking, looking, and gathering information and acting? Will the results of the project enhance the lives of those involved? ✏️ Summarize your notes in a response to your colleagues project and please post your review in the Unit 8 Discussion Forum as a reply on their post. Remember that your response will be visible to all members of the class. Note. This activity is ungraded, but gives you an opportunity to provide formative feedback for your colleagues. Unit 8 Summary In this unit you have discovered how action research is related to, and yet distinct from, other forms of research that we have explored to date. You have developed your own action research project to find a solution to your own practical problems. You have also developed a strong sense of what a good quality action research project is. Unit 8 Assessment Prepare your Presentation In your learning pod/discussion post this week, you will spend most of your time preparing an action research project presentation. Make sure you all have time to share your project idea. This will be a brainstorming session so that you can get peer feedback on your project plan before you submit it. Here are the instructions for developing your action research plan: Think about some practical problems that you have faced in your professional life that you would like to change. Share one problem with your group that you would like to address for your action research project. Discuss why it is a problem and discuss why this problem is important to you. Next, you will create an idea for action research project following the steps outlined by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015, pp. 440-442) below. Discuss the following steps with your group to provide each other with peer-feedback: Determine if an action research project is feasible. Remember, you want to use action research when you want to systematically address a practical problem in your work situation or community, and to advance your own professional development. Specify the problem you want to study. Identify the question you want to answer. The most important factor in action research is that you need to solve a practical problem. This problem is one that you face in your own practice or in your community. Identify the information that you need. This means that you need to decide who your participants will be, how many people you will study, how you will access these participants. Be specific. Describe how you will collect data. Your choices are to collect quantitative data (e.g., attendance data, test scores, or a short survey) or qualitative data (e.g., reflection journals or in-person interviews, focus groups) or both. How will you analyze the data that you collect? Will you use quantitative, numerical data that will be examined using descriptive analyses or qualitative, text-based data using content analyses exploring general themes. In action research, it is not enough to produce results from your data, you need to use those results to develop a plan for action. Describe how the results of this project will help enhance the lives of those involved. Finally, describe how you are going to implement your plan. You also need to reflect on what you have learned from implementing your plan and discuss how you will share your results with others. Complete Assignment #4: Scholarly Article Review This assignment is the next step in moving toward a literature review paper. Remember, your eventual task is to create a literature review that is synthesized from the individual research articles you have read and have taken notes on in Assignment 2. Part of that process involves the need to be able to look back at your notes and quickly see what you actually noted from these articles.

This week, in Unit 9, you will be reading about the common elements of a conclusion section of a research report in Chapter 14 of Plano-Clark and Creswell’s (2015) text. After you have read the chapter, then you will be working through the last few servant leadership articles to evaluate and interpret the conclusions section of a research report. The final section of a research report is the conclusion section and the back matter. Leedy and Ormrod observe, “Any research report should end by bringing closure to the interpretation of the data” (2010, p. 296). They assert that the conclusion is where loose threads are gathered together, and in particular, the author looks backward and distills into a few succinct paragraphs what the particular research has accomplished. All significant aspects of the research report are brought together in proper perspective, including relating the findings or results to the conclusions. Above all, a good conclusion makes explicit how the findings or results support the conclusions. Also, Leedy and Ormrod (2010) suggest that the conclusion should identify the weaknesses and limitations of the study, suggest practical implications of the findings or results, and make recommendations for further research (p. 297). 9.1.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read and Reflect 📺 To begin this learning activity, watch the following video where Dr. Strong describes the conclusion section of a research report. 📖 Next, read chapter 14, “Conclusions of Research Reports” in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015). ✏️ Next, in your reflective learning journal discuss the elements of research reports you struggle with the most and how you plan to improve on these elements moving forward? Note that your journal is not graded. These questions relate to the assessment questions for this unit. 9.2 Comparing the Contents of Conclusion Sections of Different Research Approaches Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) provide a helpful chart on page 472 that provides a comparison of the contents of the conclusion section for quantitative and qualitative research reports. In common, the conclusion will report a summary of the major results or findings, a statement of comparison of the study results or findings with those of similar previous studies, a statement of the implications of the results or findings with suggestions for practice, a statement of the limitations of the study, and a concluding statement as to the overall significance of the study. Significant differences are found in that quantitative studies explain the study results in terms of the predictions (hypotheses) discussed in the introductions, while qualitative studies “interpret their results in terms of their overall goal to explore a central phenomenon to describe its complexity and meaning” (p. 472). 9.2.1 Learning Activity: Read, Evaluate and Reflect 📖 For this learning activity, read the Eva, Robin, Sendjaya, van Dierendonck &amp; Liden (2019). Servant leadership: A systematic review and call for future research article to prepare for your group activity. 📖 Next, read the conclusion section of the article closely and practice evaluating the conclusions section of a research report. ✏️ Finally, in your learning journal, identify what you would consider a high quality conclusions section of a research report. Note that the journal is not graded, but these questions will help you prepare for the activities in this unit. 9.3 Elements of Back Matter Three common elements may be found in the back matter of a research report. You will always find a reference list—you may find additional notes and appendixes provided. Notes can provide both general and specific information. General information would include how to contact the author, who funded the study, or thanks and credits to individuals who contributed to the study. Sometimes the author will provide specific information in notes to the reader. Usually this is done by adding a superscript number in the text that will refer either to a note at the bottom of the page or an endnote found in the back matter. Either way, they serve the same purpose—they convey additional information that is useful but for whatever reason did not fit into the main body of text. Second, you will find extensive reference lists. The governing mantra proclaims, Every source cited in the article should appear in the References. Every entry in References should be cited in the main body of text. Remember that a References list is different from a Bibliography. A References List ONLY includes those sources that are actually cited. A Bibliography is much more extensive, and includes those sources which have influenced the author’s thinking whether specifically cited or not. Finally, you will often encounter appendixes. Because of the space limitations inherent in journals, appendixes in journal articles tend to be brief, and often are not provided when you really wish they were. Appendixes often provide specific details regarding data-gathering instruments such as a survey or interview questions. As a consumer of research, the back matter can be a valuable feature of the research report. The reference list can be useful in identifying further research reports for you to read, or theorists to investigate. Pay close attention to theorists or particular studies that are repeatedly referred to in the back matter of a number of research reports. As we saw earlier in this course, this is how you can make decisions as to who the primary theorists or foundational thinkers in a given discipline are. If possible, when you have identified these foundational thinkers, read them, and only read their interpreters if you have a specific reason to do so. 9.3.1 Learning Activity: Reflect ✏️ We have now concluded our investigation of research designs and the interpretation of the consequent research reports. In this learning activity, prepare a response to the following questions in your reflective learning journal: As a consumer of research reports what were the most important aspects you need to consider in a high-quality research report? How can you apply your knowledge about research reports to your work context or current experience? Note that these questions relate to the assessment for this unit. See Assessment for more details. By the end of this course you will be required to write a formal literature review for the last assignment. This section will cover what you need to know about writing a literature review. 9.4 Writing a Literature Review What is a Literature Review? A literature review is a summary of the “state of knowledge” in a given area. It involves finding key relevant articles and books, and synthesizing concepts and findings for critical (i.e., careful and judicious) application to a given problem. In other words, a good review of literature is a synthesis of what current scholarly literature has to say regarding a given problem, presented in a coherent and compelling manner. An integral step in this course is to effectively critique and summarize scholarly literature. An effective summary of an article or book will: Mention the problem being addressed. State the central purpose or focus of the study. Briefly state information about the sample, population or participants. Review key results/conclusions that relate to your problem or topic. Once you have highlighted those key points, then you need to critically evaluate the article or book. An effective critique of an article or a book will: Evaluate each section of the article/book – Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion – highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each section. When you are critically evaluating research studies, you are not just listing and summarizing them. You need to assess them, compare and contrast them, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each study or book that you have reviewed. Critical Thinking One of the distinguishing features of scholarly writing is the practice of critical thinking. Critical thinking is “that mode of thinking — about any subject, content, or problem — in which the thinker improves the quality of his or her thinking by skillfully analyzing, assessing and reconstructing it” (Foundation for Critical Thinking, 2015). In addition, critical thinking also involves creating new and original information, conclusions and ideas (Heady, 2013). Scholarly writing, should reflect higher levels of learning. According to Bloom’s (1956) taxonomy there are six levels of learning: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation. When you are writing a scholarly paper, the focus should not be on just identifying, comprehending material and applying it, your writing should also reflect analysis, synthesis and evaluation. What this means is that your writing (and your thinking) should be able to: Break down ideas into parts and see how those parts relate and are organized to demonstrate analysis. Re-arrange ideas into a new whole to demonstrate synthesis. Make judgments based on internal evidence or external criteria to demonstrate evaluation. When you are thinking critically about a scholarly article or book, you need to keep a few key questions in mind. According to the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (2017) the three key questions to ask are: 1) Are the results of the study valid? 2) What are the results? and 3) Are the results useful? These questions will help you break down ideas, re-arrange those ideas to synthesize them and help you make judgments about the information you are reading. How Much Information Is Enough? When performing a review of literature, it may be difficult to determine how much literature to review. To help in this decision, consider the main question of interest, or main subtopics, and include literature on these topics. Begin by reviewing the scholarly literature pertaining to each identified topic. Next, provide a summary of the literature that highlights the most important studies or articles, captures major themes in what you have reviewed and articulates how your research interest intersects with this literature (e.g., why we need to know more, or why the literature needs to be applied in a particular context). In essence, you want to include a summary statement of the state of knowledge in the area you are examining. Keep going until you sense that you have represented fairly the current field of literature. A good indication that you have done that is when you find authors mostly re-stating but not really advancing knowledge in the field. In other words, you have hit saturation. Here is a really helpful website that further explains what a formal literature review is: http://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/literaturereview 9.4.1 Learning Activity: Read, Watch and Reflect The literature review defines the issue you are exploring more clearly by setting the problem within a wider professional context. At first, you will be exploring the literature. It is useful to determine if there are other authors that who share your assumptions and if they have evidence you can use. You will be looking for how others have tackled the problem that you are investigating. Their outcomes can be very helpful to you. When you begin writing, think about how to structure the evidence. This should NOT be a randomly organized collection of findings from a first, second and third article. Create a set of sections that flow logically, building the case for your approach. 📖 To begin this learning activity read, chapters 7 and 8 of the Frederickson and Phelps (n.d.) text which cover topics on Synthesizing Sources and Writing your Literature Review. 📺 Next, watch the following video Literature Review Preparation by Laura Killam. This video shows you exactly how to create a summary table for your research articles. It outlines what information should go in the table and provides helpful summary hints. ✏️ Part 1: Start writing. Begin by writing a rough draft of the nature of the problem you are addressing. This will be a high-level summary of your opening paragraph of your literature review where you describe the problem to your reader. ✏️ Part 2: Create reviews of your articles/sources. The article review template (assignment 3) can be helpful when organizing your notes as you read the research on your topic. When you create an article review, make sure it is no longer than one page. Write your notes in complete sentences. ✏️ Part 3: Synthesize what others have said. After you have completed your article reviews, then you need to organize the literature into themes, dimensions, or narratives that come from what others have written. In this section you get authors to “talk” to each other. Most paragraphs in a literature review follow a very simple and redundant format. It starts by naming the author(s) and year of publication. Then it gives a short summary of the article. Then it gives the points you want to make about the article that YOU think are important. For example: Johnson (2017), in a research article that discussed leadership issues with motivating part-time workers, noted three aspects that motivated part-time workers. First, part-time workers were motivated to work harder if they had friends who worked with them. Second, part-time workers were motivated if they believed they were good at that work. Finally, part-time workers were motivated if they deemed that their work actually made a difference in other people’s lives. Note that this learning activity will be assessed in the Formal Literature Review Assignment. Unit 9 Summary In unit 9 we have focused on assessing and interpreting the discussion/conclusion section of a research report. The discussion section is where all significant aspects of the research report are brought together in proper perspective, including relating the findings or results to the conclusions. A good discussion makes explicit how the findings or results support the conclusions. References Leedy, P., &amp; Ormrod, J. (2010). Practical research: Planning and design (9th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall. Plano-Clark, V. &amp; Creswell, J. (2015). Understanding research: A consumer’s guide (2nd ed.). Boston, MA: Pearson Unit 9 Assessment Group Activity In your learning pod this week, you will evaluate the SL articles provided in this unit. After you have read the article, you will evaluate the Conclusion section of the article using the criteria provided in the Plano-Clark and Creswell text. As a group, you will prepare a short summary of your evaluation and post it on the Unit 9 forum. Remember to provide the title of your article in your summary. Checking Your Learning Now that you have completed the learning activities and assignments for this unit, check the list below to see if you can do the following: Can you discuss the similarities and differences in the discussion/conclusion section of a qualitative and quantitative research report? Can you evaluate the quality of the final sections of a research report on servant leadership? Can you apply what you have learned about the discussion/conclusion section of a research report to your own leadership context?

Battling bad science. (Video file). Retrieved from https://www.ted.com/talks/ben_goldacre_battling_bad_science 10.1 Issues of Credibility Congratulations! You have made it to the final week of LDRS 591: Scholarly Inquiry! This week you will be revisiting a question about making informed decisions, discussing why evidence-based decision making is important for the Transformational Servant Leader, and reflecting on what your expectations are now for a high quality research report. You will also be introduced to the MA Lead: Leadership Integration Project (LDRS 697/698). Before we finish this course, I want to take some time to address a fundamental question that underlies our decision-making processes: Simply stated, the question is “how can I know I can trust what I am reading?” At the heart of this issue are three interrelated concerns: Is the research work performed competently? Is it reported honestly? Are the findings presented consistent with what other researchers would conclude (Locke, et al., 2010, p. 12)? By now you are aware that the reason behind much of the tedious detail provided in research reports is aimed at addressing the question “is the research performed competently?” Great efforts are expended in the publication process to further address research competence, honesty, and consistency. As we will see, the final concern introduces an element that can be distressing. Competence and Honesty You will recall that earlier in the course it was suggested that you always check the “Peer-Reviewed or Scholarly” box when doing an online search of the literature. Your first line of establishing trust in the quality of a research article is the review process followed in the formal presentation and publishing of research. Typically, the first opportunity a researcher has to disseminate their work is when their PhD dissertation is defended and subsequently published. The process involved in the successful defense of a dissertation is lengthy and strenuous, to say the very least. In effect, all three questions are addressed by the dissertation committee, which functions, at that stage, as a committee of peers. Beyond that, another first opportunity is to present papers at conferences. Such papers are typically presented beforehand to a jury of peers who critique the paper with the above three criteria in mind. Journal publication extends the processes of peer review even beyond that of conferences. Typically, articles submitted for publication are reviewed by peers who are experts in the field, often blind (the author does not know who the reviewers are or the reviewer does not know who the author is) or double-blind (neither the author nor reviewer are known to each other). This process results in juried or refereed or peer-reviewed articles that are subsequently published. The peer-reviewing process is intended to eliminate work which is flawed in fundamental ways. However, this process is not infallible. Consider this honest statement: We must caution you, however, that it is not safe to believe that peer review operates with flawless precision as an absolute guarantor of quality in published research. The effectiveness of the peer review system can be no better than the quality of function produced by each part, and, despite the best efforts of editors and reviewers, judgments fail and mistakes do occur. Taken across journals, editors, and reviewers, there is enough residual variability to give all readers cause to be wary and to exercise one final step in quality control—by forming their own judgment about the adequacy of what they read. (Locke, et al., 2010, p. 35). Be aware that all journals are not equally selective. Every discipline has front-line journals that have the highest standards of selectivity, and equally, every discipline has journals that are remarkable for their lack of selectivity. You can get some insight into what you are dealing with if you check the requirements for document submission that are embedded somewhere in every journal. Often, you can gain insight by looking at who the editors and reviewers are, and finally, the reputation of the journal is important. The reputation of the author of the article is also very important. Academic credentials, academic honors, holding positions of influence, association with major discoveries and longevity in the field are important factors in establishing authorial reputation. These are major considerations in deciding whether a particular author’s work is foundational in a given field. Another positive indicator of research quality is if the research is funded from a prestigious funding source. Ford, Carnegie, and Pew Foundations meet those criteria, as do studies funded by the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR), National Institute of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC) . The criteria for funding from prestigious funding sources meet or exceed those for prestigious journals. Related, scholarly organizations often provide funds, or at least endorse research studies. In the field of education, the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD) is but one such organization. In the social sciences, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) is another. As you read research, there are some potential “deal-breakers” to be aware of. First, although no study will be technically perfect, beware of studies with obvious technical problems. The evaluation matrices, particularly for the introduction, methods and results sections, provided by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) are great places to begin. Studies with numerous technical problems make trust difficult to sustain. Sampling: Sampling is one of the technical aspects of research that deserves separate mention. Sampling lies at the very heart of a given research study. Two primary issues are at stake here: Does the sample truly represent the population? Does the sample allow for the generalizing of results? Replication: One of the strengths of the development of scholarly literature is the reinforcement of the veracity of findings through replication studies. A number of years ago the world was shaken by the announcement by Pons and Fleischmann of the achievement of a cold-fusion nuclear reaction. The problem was, not a single researcher was able to replicate this, and eventually the researcher’s methods were exposed as flawed. Researcher Bias: Clearly, obvious conflicts of interest with the researcher contribute to the breaking of trust. Foundational to the integrity of the research process is that the researcher be an independent, free agent. While it is normal for researchers to find results that are consistent for what was hoped for, trust is violated when the researcher has a personal vested interest in a particular favorable outcome. Locke, et al. correctly observe, “It is when the benefits become tangible rather than just intellectual that there is reason for special caution” (2010, p. 47). For that reason, it is always wise to be cautious about studies released by organizations rather than the study author. Finally, more subtle conflicts of interest emerge when personal biases of the investigator remain unacknowledged and unaccounted for. Included might be issues of theoretical commitments, beliefs and ideological dispositions that influence the research process such that the research itself becomes a tool for advancing the researcher’s personal agenda. Included in this is the accusation that the researcher “found what he/she was looking for.” Finally, obvious errors either due to carelessness or poor researcher decisions contribute to the erosion of trust. Poor scholarship is evident when such errors are sufficient to call into question whether the researcher has even a basic understanding of the field. 10.1.1 Learning Activity: Watch and Reflect We have spent a great deal of time wrestling with the specifics of research reports, and in so doing, you have developed set of expectations regarding the quality of research reports and you have increased your ability to sense potential problems. In this learning activity you are asked to do the following: 📺 Watch the TED talk video Battling Bad Science. ✏️ In your reflective learning journal, consider the following questions: 1. How can I know that I can trust what I am reading? How do I know the research has been performed competently? How do I know the research is reported honestly? How do I know the findings presented are consistent with what other researchers would conclude? Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. 10.2 Leadership Decisions Revisited In unit 1 you were asked to discuss a recent decision you made as a leader. You were then asked to think through how you made that decision. For example, did you base the decision on previous experience, values, company policy, empirical evidence or expert opinion? This course has emphasized evidence-based leadership by equipping you to access, evaluate, and apply the latest empirically-based evidence and contribute to the scholarship base in the area of leadership studies. My hope is that this course will convince you of the importance of basing your leadership decisions on the best evidence available. 10.2.1 Learning Activity: Reflect ✏️ As a final entry in your learning journal, reflect on the following questions: In light of what you have learned in this course, prepare a response explaining why you think evidence-based decision making is important for the Transformational Servant leader. How will you use scholarly evidence in your leadership practice moving forward? Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit. Unit 10 Summary We have come to the conclusion of our course together. In this unit, you had the opportunity to revisit a question about making informed decisions, discuss why evidence-based decision making is important for the Transformational Servant Leader, and reflect on your own expectations for a high quality research report. It has been a pleasure to teach all of you. I look forward to hearing about your journey ahead as you progress throughout the MA Lead Program. Best Wishes, Dr. Strong Unit 10 Assessment Group Activity In your learning pod this week, you will take turns answering the following questions: Are there any aspects of the final literature review paper that you are struggling to understand? If so, share some of your struggles with the group so that you can support each other as you prepare your final literature review paper. What new insights have you learned about the research process and how would those insights inform your decision making now? Why do you think evidence-based decision making is important for the transformational servant leader?

Assignment Clarifying Your Research Interest The Master of Arts in Leadership program values the application of best practices to your personal and professional practice. Before we get into some of the concrete realities of accessing scholarly literature, we would like you to take time to reflect on and articulate some of the salient leadership interests in your personal and professional life and practice. At the end of the MA Leadership program (in LDRS 697 &amp; 698) you will get an opportunity to create a project based on a salient leadership problem/interest. It is good to start thinking about what the topic may be now so that you can use the assignments in this course to start thinking about topic for your final project. For this assignment, you will write a short 2 page paper describing your leadership interests (personal and/or professional). Based on these leadership interests, you will generate research questions amenable to scholarly inquiry. 10.2.1.0.1 Steps to complete this assignment Step 1: In the opening paragraph, state the salient leadership interests in your personal and professional life and practice. Identify one problem or topic that you would like to investigate and provide a brief introduction to your topic. Step 2: Next, use the following three statements to help you get some clarity about what exactly you want to address in your question. If you can fill out these statements, then you most likely have a narrow enough topic with enough direction to perform some great research. I am researching ____________________________________(What? Topic) because I want to find out _________________________(So What? Issue/question) in order to ________________________________ (Now What? Application/Purpose). Step 3: Identify the research question you want to pursue for your final research paper. Outline reasons or a rationale for why you chose this question. Discuss why this topic is important to you. If you are struggling to identify a question, consider where you see the greatest need for change in the field you want to work as a leader. What would you propose to change in your field and why? Consider what is working really well in your field and how could you discover best practices. Step 4: APA Formatting is required for this assignment. Specifically, an APA title page, font, line spacing, margins, alignment, and paragraph indentation. See the Sample Template located at the bottom of this page if you need help understanding how this assignment will be structured. Step 5: Upload your document to the Assignment 1 drop box in Moodle. 10.2.2 Rubric for Assignment # 1 Elements Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following… Communication The research question is presented clearly and is well developed and appropriate for the assignment. One question is clearly chosen as a focus for examining future research. The rationale allows for a high level of understanding. Organization and Clarity Excellent organization of content. Communication flows very smoothly. Excellent style and language usage. Effective sentence variety and word choice. Correct grammar, punctuation, spelling, and proofreading. APA Formatting Title page, font, line spacing, margins, alignment, paragraph indentation. 10.2.3 Literature Search The purpose of this assignment is to develop your skills to search, retrieve, and begin reviewing relevant literature. This assignment will include the “paper trail” that provides the details of your search for relevant literature. In order to complete this assignment you will need to: Identify your research question and key search terms. Use search strategies to locate and select literature. Create a table that summarizes information from your search results. Use APA 7 formatting requirements. Step 1: Identify your research topic. In one paragraph (3-5 sentences), provide a general but engaging introduction that describes the context of the problem you are investigating. What generated your interest in this topic? What problem does your topic address? Next, in one paragraph (3-5 sentences) write a brief statement outlining your personal/professional interest in this topic. You will want to describe the relevant issues included in your problem statement, including the urgency, the controversies, and anything else that will convince your reader that your problem is worth pursuing. Why do you think your topic is important? Conclude this section with the specific research question you will be investigating. Step 2: Conduct a search for scholarly articles on your topic. Identify the searchable keywords that arise from your problem statement and then search for 5 scholarly articles on your research topic. Record your search terms. Begin your search by starting broadly. Using your keywords, search the Library One Search engine found at the TWU Library. This search will yield all sources of information related to your topic. From this search, identify key sources that you have found to be relevant to your research question. Make a note of these sources by saving this information in a word document or another electronic format. Next, you will conduct a search of at least two academic databases using your keywords. The list of academic databases can be found here at the TWU Article Databases. You will need to identify key academic journal articles that you have found to be relevant to your research question. Examples of academic databases are Academic Search Ultimate and Business Source Complete. Finally, move into the literature available on the internet by conducting a search using a search engine such as Google Scholar or the Directory of Open Access Journals. You will need to identify credible sources that you have found to be relevant to your research question. Step 3: Summarize your procedure. In one paragraph (5-7 sentences), describe how you chose your particular articles. In other words, what procedures did you follow and what inclusion and exclusion criteria did you use to keep and eliminate articles. For example, the inclusion criteria may include the following elements: peer-reviewed, publication range, language, how you accessed the information. The exclusion criteria may include the following factors: an article/book that does not meet the inclusion criteria, and non-English full-text studies were excluded even if an English translation of the abstract was provided. See the template provided in a link below for an example of the “procedure” section. Step 4: Create a summary table of your literature search results. In a table, you will summarize the information you have collected from step 2. Complete a summary of each relevant article you found in a matrix table like the one below (change headings to suit your needs). Please note: this will take you the most time, so make sure you set aside enough time to read through the abstracts of the articles to fill in the criteria in the table below. Here is a helpful video explaining How to Read an Academic Paper. Table 1. Literature Review Search Summary Matrix Author/year Article Title Purpose Key Findings Source 1 Source 2 Source 3 Source 4 Source 5 Step 5: Create an APA style reference list: List all references on the last page of your document in APA format. APA formatting is required for this assignment. You should focus on general formatting (including a title page), in-text citations and references. For more details visit the APA Style Checklist. Step 6: APA formatting: APA Formatting is required for this assignment. Specifically, an APA title page, font, line spacing, margins, alignment, and paragraph indentation. Adding citations to support statements/facts made and APA style reference list. See the See the Sample Template if you need help understanding how this assignment will be structured. Note: This paper should be a maximum of 8 pages (including title page, body of paper, reference list). Step 6: Please submit your assignment using the Assignment drop box on Moodle.

Assignment: Formal Literature Review In this assignment you will demonstrate your scholarly inquiry learning by writing a graduate-level literature review. This assignment is focused on the leadership interest you have identified and defined in the literature search, and your scholarly article review. This assignment will be your analysis and synthesis of the literature, presented in scholarly prose, fully compliant with APA (7th edition) format. 10.2.3.0.1 What type of literature review is required for this assignment? The “type” or “style” of literature review that I am asking you to write for your fifth assignment is called a Traditional or Narrative Review. This type of review provides an overview of research on a particular topic that critiques and summarizes a body of literature. It is typically broad in focus. Relevant past research is selected and synthesized into a coherent discussion. Methodologies, findings and limits of the existing body of knowledge are discussed in narrative form. This type of review requires a sufficiently focused research question. You can find an excellent example of this type of literature review paper here: Fear, W., &amp; Erikson-Brown, A. (2014). Good quality discussion is necessary but not sufficient in asynchronous tuition: A brief narrative review of the literature. Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks 18(2). Retrieved from http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1036265.pdf 10.2.3.0.2 How should you organize and write a literature review? In their textbook, Fredericksen and Phelps (n.d.) outline the steps you need to take to write a literature review. Begin by reading chapter 7 “Synthesizing Sources” and Chapter 8 “Writing a Literature Review”. Please note that I am NOT asking you to review ALL of the empirical evidence on your topic (this would be a huge undertaking). I am asking you to select a minimum of 10 scholarly sources that you will use to review for your paper. This means you are writing a literature review in a maximum of 12 pages (including title page, body of paper, reference list). 10.2.4 Requirements for the Formal Literature Review Paper 10.2.4.0.1 Title page Create a title page in APA format. 10.2.4.1 Introduction The introduction of your paper should begin with one paragraph summarizing in general terms your research topic. This information should stand out and capture your reader’s attention. This introductory material should stand below the restated paper title without any further heading that indicates it is an introduction. In the next few paragraphs it is important to provide your reader with a brief overview of the problem. It is here that you want to begin to set the stage for your research story. You can build the overview by answering these questions in a few paragraphs: What was your research about? [Provide a general but engaging introduction that describes the context of your paper.] What generated your interest in this research? What problem does your research address? Why is your research important? How does your paper address the problem? What is the central research question? It is important also to include the definition of any key terms that you will be using throughout your paper. Remember to include appropriate reference citations, and include any reference you cite in your paper in the reference list. On the basis of your personal knowledge as well as your investigation of the literature, provide a brief discussion of the major issues or gaps that have been identified related to the topic that is being investigated. This addresses the importance or the significance of your study. To conclude this section, provide a brief statement outlining the purpose of the study and be explicit about the research question you will be addressing. If you wish, you may also include a paragraph about your personal interest in this topic as a researcher. Here is a checklist of what you should include in this section: Identify the general topic. Establish the importance of this topic to the field. Establish your point of view or reason for interest in the topic. Clarify key terms related to the topic. 10.2.4.2 Body (Critical Review of the Literature) In this section you are now going to organize what you have learned by summarizing the major themes with full reference citations. Whether you choose to follow a study-by-study or a thematic approach, it is very important that you do not just simply recite a summary of the research report. The purpose of a literature review is to connect research reports to your stated problem through analysis and synthesis. Throughout this process you must critically appraise the relevance and value of the literature. The literature review should include major findings, and key conclusions, and a critical evaluation of the articles you have reviewed. When you are critically evaluating research studies, you are not just listing and summarizing items, you need to assess them, compare and contrast them, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each study that you have reviewed. Critically evaluate and integrate your findings in an unbiased and systematic way. Identify inconsistencies in study results and identify points of contention in theories, conceptualizations, and methods in the literature (Cooper, 2003). How to move from an article review to a paragraph in a literature review? Your task is to create a literature review that is synthesized from the individual research articles you have read and have taken notes on in Assignment 2 and 4. Part of that process revolves around the need to be able to look back at your notes and quickly see what you actually noted from these articles. These notes will be included in any literature review you write. Create an article review for each article you collected for this final assignment. This will help you organize your findings and create the notes you need to write the paragraphs in the “results” section of your literature review paper. Use the Article Review Template so that you can go back - after many weeks - and see your organized notes. Then, you literally organize your notes into the order you wish to present them, cut and paste things into a new word file that becomes your literature review, and then do the final cleaning up and additions. Writing an Introductory Paragraph After you have edited and revised your article review paragraphs, it’s time to write the Introductory Paragraph of your critical literature review. This paragraph gives readers a sense of what’s coming. For example, The question this review of literature addressed was, [XXXX]. This review of literature highlighted XX distinct themes including, a) XX, b) XX, and c) XX. Note: Remind your reader about your research question. Then give them an introduction to the themes you will be exploring. Writing a Concluding Paragraph After you have edited and revised your article review paragraphs and organized them into themes, written the Introductory Paragraph, you are now ready to write the Concluding Paragraph of your findings. The concluding paragraph gives readers a sense of what’s coming – for you. For example, “To conclude, this review of literature suggested that researchers should …. (finish by adding your thoughts)….. “ or you state a conclusion about the similarities and differences in the articles you reviewed. Here is a checklist of what you should include in this section: Did you organize this section by themes or categories or chronologically? Did you include at least 10 academic (peer-reviewed) sources? Have you summarized and critically evaluated the articles you have reviewed? Did you expand upon at least 2 main themes, each based upon multiple sources? Did you synthesize consistencies across studies and within themes? Did you discuss inconsistencies across studies and within themes? Discuss the connection between the themes and the research question? Did you write an introductory paragraph? Did you write a concluding paragraph? 10.2.4.3 Discussion In this section you should open by restating the problem you are investigating. You then want to state the major findings and discuss whether or not your literature review supported or did not support your research question. In this section you should describe your own interpretation of the research you reviewed (e.g., identify gaps, inconsistencies, strengths, weaknesses) and link these interpretations back to the question that you started with. You also need to discuss the limitations of your findings and make recommendations (and offer a rationale) for future research on the topic. End this section with a commentary on the importance of your findings and provide any implications that may result from the findings. Here is a checklist of what you should include in this section: Provide a concise summary of the findings and conclusions in a balanced and impartial way. What are the key strengths and/or limitations of the literature? Offer a rationale for why future research should be conducted on this topic. What would you suggest based on the limitations? Make recommendations for practice. 10.2.4.4 Conclusion In this final section, you will bring your paper to a close. Consider the following questions as writing prompts for this final conclusion (Summarize in one short paragraph): What was your research question? What did you learn from your review of the literature? Why do these results matter? What is one final thought you think others need to know as a result of your work? 10.2.4.5 References At the very end list your references. Reference lists must start on a new page, and must be formatted according to APA (7th edition) guidelines pertaining to which type of literature is being cited (i.e., book by one author, book with an editor, journal article, blog and so forth). 10.2.4.6 Your Literature Review Checklist Does your final paper: Have an engaging introduction? Have a critical review of literature that expands upon at least 2 main themes, each based upon multiple sources (10 sources total). Support findings with evidence from multiple sources? Synthesize consistencies across studies and within themes? Have an engaging discussion and conclusion? Have an accurate reference list? Follow APA 7th style and formatting?

Assignment: Scholarly Article Review This assignment is the next step in moving toward a literature review paper. Remember, your eventual task is to create a literature review that is synthesized from the individual research articles you have read and have taken notes on in your literature search assignment. Part of that process revolves around the need to be able to look back at your notes and quickly see what you actually noted from these articles. To be efficient, you need to create the easiest way possible to organize the notes that you have made. Using a format that includes: (a) citation, (b) a 2-3 sentence summary, (c) key points (numbered 1-2-3-4), (d) a “So what?” and (e) a “Now what?” is the most efficient way to organize your notes. To be transparent, these parts will be included in any literature review you write. This template allows you to easily go back - after many weeks - and see your organized notes. Then, you literally organize your notes into the order you wish to present them, cut and paste things into a new word file that becomes your literature review, and then do the final cleaning up and additions. For this assignment, you will write a review of a journal article using the guidelines provided below. This assignment should not be any longer than 2 pages. Note that this is rather brief, requiring you to synthesize a lot of information in a concise way, which can be challenging at first. Writing drafts of each section and then editing these to consolidate information is recommended. 10.3.0.1 Instructions to complete this assignment: Step 1: To begin this assignment, select one peer-reviewed journal article from your literature review search assignment and provide the citation in APA 7th edition format. STEP 2: Open the article review template found at the bottom of this page. Begin filling it in. Step 3: Next, in 2-3 sentences summarize the purpose, problem and/or question(s). Provide a clear description of context and/or key participants and a strong summary. The summary should offer insightful comments on the article reviewed. Step 4: List three to five points that you believe should be remembered. These are your choices, and could differ from person to person. They do not have to cover the entire article; focus on what you care about. Step 5: This next section should be a personal reflection of where the article fits into your own thinking. It should be used to connect what you have read with what you think. Step 6: Next, includes notes that help you move forward. Write a more personal summary of what you found and how these findings relate to your own needs in the research you are engaged in. Step 7: APA formatting is required for this assignment. Specifically, an APA title page, font, line spacing, margins, alignment, and paragraph indentation. Adding citations to support statements/facts made and a APA style reference. For this assignment you will also need to demonstrate clear and concise writing. For more details visit the APA Style Checklist. See the Sample Template at the bottom of this page if you need help understanding how this assignment will be structured. Step 8: Please have your assignment reviewed by a writing coach prior to submitting this assignment. Your TWU Learning Commons Report must be included as a second page of this assignment. Please submit the assignment using the Assignment drop box on Moodle. 10.3.0.2 Rubric for Scholarly Article Review Criteria Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria…. Citation Reference is present with no APA errors. Summary Clearly identifies the purpose, problem and/or question(s). Provides a clear introduction, a description of context and/or key participants and a strong summary conclusion. The summary offers insightful comments on both the strengths and limitations of the article reviewed. What? Describes in an explicit, detailed manner the 3-5 points you believe should be remembered. This may include the problem, and/or situation, definitions of technical terms and key concepts. Concrete examples, illustrations and quotations to clarify and enhance understanding without imposing judgment, interpretation and/or personal bias. So What? Clearly connects with your own understanding of the topic. Supports and connects knowledge claims with concrete examples from scholarly literature and previous experiences. Now What? Clearly explains the practical applications or implications. Describes how claims have confirmed, differed and/or enhanced your personal and/or practical understanding of an issue or phenomenon. APA Formatting The critique follows APA 7 formatting standards. Organization and Clarity Excellent organization of content. Excellent use of linkages and transitions. Communication flows very smoothly. Excellent introduction and conclusion. Expression and Mechanics Excellent style and language usage. Very effective sentence variety and word choice. Impeccable grammar, punctuation, spelling, and proofreading. Formal Literature Review In this assignment you will demonstrate your scholarly inquiry learning by writing a graduate-level literature review. This assignment is focused on the leadership interest you have identified and defined in the literature search, and your scholarly article review. This assignment will be your analysis and synthesis of the literature, presented in scholarly prose, fully compliant with APA (7th edition) format. 10.3.0.2.1 What type of literature review is required for this assignment? The “type” or “style” of literature review that I am asking you to write for your fifth assignment is called a Traditional or Narrative Review. This type of review provides an overview of research on a particular topic that critiques and summarizes a body of literature. It is typically broad in focus. Relevant past research is selected and synthesized into a coherent discussion. Methodologies, findings and limits of the existing body of knowledge are discussed in narrative form. This type of review requires a sufficiently focused research question. You can find an excellent example of this type of literature review paper here: Fear, W., &amp; Erikson-Brown, A. (2014). Good quality discussion is necessary but not sufficient in asynchronous tuition: A brief narrative review of the literature. Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks 18(2). Retrieved from http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1036265.pdf 10.3.0.2.2 How should you organize and write a literature review? In their textbook, Fredericksen and Phelps (n.d.) outline the steps you need to take to write a literature review. Begin by reading chapter 7 “Synthesizing Sources” and Chapter 8 “Writing a Literature Review”. Please note that I am NOT asking you to review ALL of the empirical evidence on your topic (this would be a huge undertaking). I am asking you to select a minimum of 10 scholarly sources that you will use to review for your paper. This means you are writing a literature review in a maximum of 12 pages (including title page, body of paper, reference list). 10.3.1 Requirements for the Formal Literature Review Paper 10.3.1.0.1 Title page Create a title page in APA format. 10.3.1.1 Introduction The introduction of your paper should begin with one paragraph summarizing in general terms your research topic. This information should stand out and capture your reader’s attention. This introductory material should stand below the restated paper title without any further heading that indicates it is an introduction. In the next few paragraphs it is important to provide your reader with a brief overview of the problem. It is here that you want to begin to set the stage for your research story. You can build the overview by answering these questions in a few paragraphs: What was your research about? [Provide a general but engaging introduction that describes the context of your paper.] What generated your interest in this research? What problem does your research address? Why is your research important? How does your paper address the problem? What is the central research question? It is important also to include the definition of any key terms that you will be using throughout your paper. Remember to include appropriate reference citations, and include any reference you cite in your paper in the reference list. On the basis of your personal knowledge as well as your investigation of the literature, provide a brief discussion of the major issues or gaps that have been identified related to the topic that is being investigated. This addresses the importance or the significance of your study. To conclude this section, provide a brief statement outlining the purpose of the study and be explicit about the research question you will be addressing. If you wish, you may also include a paragraph about your personal interest in this topic as a researcher. Here is a checklist of what you should include in this section: Identify the general topic. Establish the importance of this topic to the field. Establish your point of view or reason for interest in the topic. Clarify key terms related to the topic. 10.3.1.2 Body (Critical Review of the Literature) In this section you are now going to organize what you have learned by summarizing the major themes with full reference citations. Whether you choose to follow a study-by-study or a thematic approach, it is very important that you do not just simply recite a summary of the research report. The purpose of a literature review is to connect research reports to your stated problem through analysis and synthesis. Throughout this process you must critically appraise the relevance and value of the literature. The literature review should include major findings, and key conclusions, and a critical evaluation of the articles you have reviewed. When you are critically evaluating research studies, you are not just listing and summarizing items, you need to assess them, compare and contrast them, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each study that you have reviewed. Critically evaluate and integrate your findings in an unbiased and systematic way. Identify inconsistencies in study results and identify points of contention in theories, conceptualizations, and methods in the literature (Cooper, 2003). How to move from an article review to a paragraph in a literature review? Your task is to create a literature review that is synthesized from the individual research articles you have read and have taken notes on in Assignment 2 and 4. Part of that process revolves around the need to be able to look back at your notes and quickly see what you actually noted from these articles. These notes will be included in any literature review you write. Create an article review for each article you collected for this final assignment. This will help you organize your findings and create the notes you need to write the paragraphs in the “results” section of your literature review paper. Use the Article Review Template so that you can go back - after many weeks - and see your organized notes. Then, you literally organize your notes into the order you wish to present them, cut and paste things into a new word file that becomes your literature review, and then do the final cleaning up and additions. Writing an Introductory Paragraph After you have edited and revised your article review paragraphs, it’s time to write the Introductory Paragraph of your critical literature review. This paragraph gives readers a sense of what’s coming. For example, The question this review of literature addressed was, [XXXX]. This review of literature highlighted XX distinct themes including, a) XX, b) XX, and c) XX. Note: Remind your reader about your research question. Then give them an introduction to the themes you will be exploring. Writing a Concluding Paragraph After you have edited and revised your article review paragraphs and organized them into themes, written the Introductory Paragraph, you are now ready to write the Concluding Paragraph of your findings. The concluding paragraph gives readers a sense of what’s coming – for you. For example, “To conclude, this review of literature suggested that researchers should …. (finish by adding your thoughts)….. “ or you state a conclusion about the similarities and differences in the articles you reviewed. Here is a checklist of what you should include in this section: Did you organize this section by themes or categories or chronologically? Did you include at least 10 academic (peer-reviewed) sources? Have you summarized and critically evaluated the articles you have reviewed? Did you expand upon at least 2 main themes, each based upon multiple sources? Did you synthesize consistencies across studies and within themes? Did you discuss inconsistencies across studies and within themes? Discuss the connection between the themes and the research question? Did you write an introductory paragraph? Did you write a concluding paragraph? 10.3.1.3 Discussion In this section you should open by restating the problem you are investigating. You then want to state the major findings and discuss whether or not your literature review supported or did not support your research question. In this section you should describe your own interpretation of the research you reviewed (e.g., identify gaps, inconsistencies, strengths, weaknesses) and link these interpretations back to the question that you started with. You also need to discuss the limitations of your findings and make recommendations (and offer a rationale) for future research on the topic. End this section with a commentary on the importance of your findings and provide any implications that may result from the findings. Here is a checklist of what you should include in this section: Provide a concise summary of the findings and conclusions in a balanced and impartial way. What are the key strengths and/or limitations of the literature? Offer a rationale for why future research should be conducted on this topic. What would you suggest based on the limitations? Make recommendations for practice. 10.3.1.4 Conclusion In this final section, you will bring your paper to a close. Consider the following questions as writing prompts for this final conclusion (Summarize in one short paragraph): What was your research question? What did you learn from your review of the literature? Why do these results matter? What is one final thought you think others need to know as a result of your work? 10.3.1.5 References At the very end list your references. Reference lists must start on a new page, and must be formatted according to APA (7th edition) guidelines pertaining to which type of literature is being cited (i.e., book by one author, book with an editor, journal article, blog and so forth). 10.3.1.6 Your Literature Review Checklist Does your final paper: Have an engaging introduction? Have a critical review of literature that expands upon at least 2 main themes, each based upon multiple sources (10 sources total). Support findings with evidence from multiple sources? Synthesize consistencies across studies and within themes? Have an engaging discussion and conclusion? Have an accurate reference list? Follow APA 7th style and formatting? See the Sample Template at the bottom of this page if you need help understanding how this assignment will be structured. APA formatting is required for this assignment. You should focus on general formatting, writing clearly and concisely, in-text citations and references. For more details visit the APA Style Checklist.

The sequential order of the sections of my paper are: Title Page, Body of Paper, References. Title Page (page 1): Page number 1 is flush right in the header. The title of my paper summarizes the main idea of the paper and is simple and engaging. The title is written in title case which means the first letter of any major words capitalized (4 words or greater). It is boldface, centered, and positioned in the upper half of the page. My name is double spaced under the title. It is not bold, underlined, or abnormal font. The institutional affiliation is double spaced under my name. It is not bold, underlined, or abnormal font. Please provide the course number and name for which the paper is being submitted (e.g., LDRS 591), the instructors name (e.g., Dr. Heather Strong), and the assignment submission date (e.g., August 20, 2020). General Formatting for Subsequent Pages: Each page header has the page number flush right, all on the same line. The paper title is repeated in full on the first page of the body of the paper. The title is written in title case, centered and bold. The paper is organized with appropriate headings. APA 7th Headings Level Format 1 Centered, Boldface, Title Case Heading Text starts a new paragraph. 2 Flush left, Boldface, Title Case Heading Text starts a new paragraph. 3 *Flush Left, Boldface Italic, Title Case Heading* Text starts a new paragraph. 4 Indented, Boldface Title Case Heading Ending With a Period. Paragraph text continues on the same line as the same paragraph. 5 *Indented, Boldface Italic, Title Case Heading Ending With a Period.* Paragraph text continues on the same line as the same paragraph. The introduction should not carry a heading label. Paragraphs in the body of the paper are indented 5-7 spaces or one tab stop. Spacing between sentences is 1 space. Lists can be enumerated or bulleted. Within a single sentence for short lists use the format, (a), (b), (c), etc. For a list of sentences or short paragraphs, use a list format: 1. 2. Bullets can be used if it better describes the list but not preferred, e.g. a lot of numbers are used in the list. Writing Clearly and Concisely: I have not used more words than are necessary to convey meaning. I have used direct, declarative sentences with simple, common words. I have not used paragraphs that run longer than one double spaced manuscript page. Each pronoun refers clearly to its antecedent and agrees with the antecedent in number (singular or plural) and gender. Personal pronouns are used sparingly. I have only used “we” to refer only to myself and my coauthors. I have avoided using alliteration, rhyming, poetic expressions, and clichés. I have used metaphors sparingly. I used the active rather than the passive voice, and I have selected tense or mood carefully. I have used bias-free language. I have omitted the use of slang. For any numbers written in the text, I have spelled out zero through nine and the rest are Arabic numerals. I used the spell check on my word processor and read through the paper carefully to catch any typos, left out words, punctuation issues, and grammatical errors. In-text Citations: Direct quotations include the author (or title if no author), the date, and specific part of the source (page #, paragraph # or section title). For example: (Strong, 2020, p.3). Parenthetical citations use the author and date and they appear in parentheses for example: (Strong, 2020). Narrative citations are incorporated into the text as part of a sentence. The authors name appears in the text and the date appears immediately after the name in parentheses. For example, Strong (2020), has suggested that it is very important to learn the rules of APA style in scholarly writing. All quotations &lt; 40 words are enclosed in quotation marks. The in-text citation is placed within parentheses and comes before the ending punctuation. For example: “The servant-leader is servant first…It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve, to serve first. Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead” (Greenleaf, 1977, p.7). All quotations &gt; 40 words are shown as an indented block quote with no additional beginning paragraph indenting. The in-text citation is placed within parentheses and comes after the punctuation. For example: ​ Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. He or she is sharply different from the person who is leader first, perhaps because of the need to assuage an unusual power drive or to acquire material possessions. For such it will be a later choice to serve – after leadership is established. The leader-first and the servant-first are two extreme types. Between them there are shadings and blends that are part of the infinite variety of human nature. (Greenleaf, 1977, p.7) Put commas and periods within quotation marks, except when a parenthetical reference follows. For example: He said, “I may forget your name, but I never forget a face.” History is stained with blood spilled in the name of “civilization.” When a parenthetical reference follows the quote, punctuation comes after. For example, Mullen, criticizing the apparent inaction, writes, “Donahue’s policy was to do nothing” (p. 24). Paraphrasing is a restatement of the original source in my own words. Paraphrased in text citations include the author (or title if no author) and the date. It is optional to include the specific page, paragraph, or section of a source that is paraphrased. For any sources with multiple authors: for one or two authors, include the authors names in every citation. For example: (Strong &amp; Parsons, 2020)… For a source with 3+ authors, include the name of only the first author and put “et al.” in every citation. For example, (Strong et al., 2020)… If the in-text citation is included in the sentence I am writing and I have multiple authors, the word and is spelled out. For example: Jones, Smith, and Black (2010)… If the in-text citation is included in a parentheses an ampersand is used to separate the next to last and last authors. For example: (Jones, Smith, &amp; Black, 2010)… When an author is repeated within a paragraph, with no other sources used in between, I can omit the date. For a new paragraph, include all the elements of the in text citation per above. References: The page title, References, is centered, 1 inch from the top of the page and starts a new page. Standard font should be used in boldface. All sources listed in the References have at least 1 corresponding in text citation. References are listed in alphabetical order by the authors last name. Every reference list entry has who, when, what, and where. All lines are double spaced and for each entry the hanging indent is used. For example: Parsons, J., &amp; Taylor, L. (2011). Improving student engagement. Current Issues In Education, 14(1), 101-12. http://cie.asu.edu/ Only initials are used for first and/or second names of authors. There is a space between initials. For example: Strong, H. A. If there are multiple authors, they are listed in the order they appear on the original source. Authors in the references are separated by commas (even for 2 authors) and an ampersand is used before the last author. Year of publication follows the authors of the article in parentheses. Titles of books, journals, technical reports are given in italics, as are journal titles. Titles of books, journal articles, web sites are in lower case except for the first word, first word after a colon and any proper nouns. The title of a web page that is an article contained in a larger web site is not italicized. Journal article titles and book article titles are not italicized. Volume numbers are given in italics. Issue numbers are enclosed in parenthesis and not formatted with italics. Paging is given as a range (e.g. 45-56) without using p. or pp. except for newspapers or magazines without a volume and issue number. Publication information (books) includes the publishers name (no location). For electronic articles, a DOI is used at the end using the following format https://doi.org/XXXXXXXXXXXXX For electronic articles, if there is no DOI, then use the publisher’s url. For any citations ending with a URL all hyperlinking (blue, underline) is included and there is no period at the end of the hyperlink. APA Style uses two kinds of capitalization to format reference titles: title case and sentence case. APA’s title case refers to a capitalization style in which most words are capitalized, and sentence case refers to a capitalization style in which most words are lowercase. The titles of works that stand alone (such as a book or a report) are italicized in both the text and the reference list. The titles of works that are part of a greater whole (such as an article, which is part of a journal, or a book chapter, which is part of a book) are enclosed in quotation marks and written in title case.

Participation/Group Work In this course you will be meeting weekly with a small group in class to work through course content. Some weeks you will be required to submit a document showing your work. Specific instructions for each week are provided below. Please click on the link for each week to view the instructions. Unit 1 Group Discussion In your learning pod, you are asked to discuss the following questions: Part 1: Begin by introducing yourself and explaining what your experience is with research. What excites you most about this class and what are you worried about? Next, discuss what you have learned about the differences between informal research (everyday problem solving) and scholarly inquiry (formal research). Part 2: Will be discussed in class. As a group, prepare a 1-page summary of each of your group discussion and post it on the Unit 1 Forum. Unit 2 Group Activity In your learning pod, you will do some research on the benefits of a popular health topic (your choice). Begin by searching for literature on your topic. Choose an article, or blog post, or video, or other internet source that you found on your topic. Determine if your source is credible or not by using the checklist below. Currency – Is the source current (&lt;10 yrs) or out of date? Relevance - Does the information relate to your topic or answer your question? Who is the intended audience? Authority – Who is the author and who published the source? Accuracy - Where does the information come from? Is the information supported by evidence? Has the information been peer reviewed Purpose - What is the purpose of the information? to inform? teach? sell? entertain? persuade? Is the information fact? opinion? propaganda? As a group, prepare a short 1-page summary of your findings on the credibility of the source on your health topic. Share your findings with the class on the Unit 2 Forum. Resource: Use Evaluating Resource : the CRAAP TEST Unit 3 Group Activity In your learning pod, you will begin by discussing the elements of APA style or scholarly writing that you struggle with and how you plan to improve on these elements before you submit your next assignment. Next, create a short presentation on a section of the APA manual. You can create a shared presentation using Google Slides or Google Docs. Please be creative! Instructions for this group activity will be provided in class. Please upload a shared link to your APA presentation in the Unit 3 Forum so that the rest of your classmates can view your presentation. Resource: APA Presentation (Exemplar) Unit 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 Group Activity The activities for Units 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 will be provided under the Assignment 3 tab. Unit 8 Group Activity In your learning pod, you will spend most of your time sharing your ideas for your action research project that you will be presenting in a group presentation. Make sure you all have time to share your project ideas. As a group you will just choose one project to develop together and present. Here are the instructions for developing your action research presentation: Think about some practical problems that you have faced in your professional life that you would like to change. Share the problems with your group and as a group choose one that you would like to address for your action research presentation. Discuss why it is a problem and discuss why this problem is important to you. Next, you will create an idea for action research project following the steps outlined below. Determine if an action research project is feasible. Remember, you want to use action research when you want to systematically address a practical problem in your work situation or community, and to advance your own professional development. Specify the problem you want to study. Identify the question you want to answer. The most important factor in action research is that you need to solve a practical problem. This problem is one that you face in your own practice or in your community. Identify the information that you need. This means that you need to decide who your participants will be, how many people you will study, how you will access these participants. Be specific. Describe how you will collect data. Your choices are to collect quantitative data (e.g., attendance data, test scores, or a short survey) or qualitative data (e.g., reflection journals or in-person interviews, focus groups) or both. How will you analyze the data that you collect? Will you use quantitative, numerical data that will be examined using descriptive analyses or qualitative, text-based data using content analyses exploring general themes. In action research, it is not enough to produce results from your data, you need to use those results to develop a plan for action. Describe how the results of this project will help enhance the lives of those involved. Next, describe how you are going to implement your plan. Finally, you also need to reflect on what you have learned from implementing your plan and discuss how you will share your results with others. Note: This learning activity will be a group presentation of one action research project idea. Post your presentation on the Unit 8 forum for peer-review. Resource: Action Research Presentation (Exemplar) Unit 10 Group Activity In your learning pod, take turns answering the following questions: Are there any aspects of the final literature review paper that you are struggling to understand? If so, share some of your struggles with the group so that you can support each other as you prepare your final literature review paper. What are the most significant concepts you have learned about high-quality research report? Explain why these ideas were significant for you. What new insights have you learned about the research process and how would those insights inform your decision making now? Why do you think evidence-based decision making is important for the transformational servant leader? Participation/Group Work Grading Criteria The group assignments will be graded in three parts. The following criteria will be used: Part 1: Your instructors evaluation of the content. Part 2: Your peer-evaluation of your contribution to the group work.
