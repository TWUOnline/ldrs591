# LDRS 591 Communities{-}

The MA Lead and MAEL degree [Leadership Competency Model](https://www.twu.ca/leadership-ma/competency-model) emphasizes specific leadership capabilities that all learners will experience in their learning journeys.

As one of the key competencies is Relationships and Collaboration, we want to encourage you to consider how you will build community with other learners.

In this course, we have the following tools available to help foster community in your course, including other students who have previously taken LDRS 591. Some of these tools will be prescribed and graded (e.g. Moodle Discussion Forums), others will be up to you to take advantage of.

Check with your course syllabus for which community tools will be used, and consider building your own Community of Practice with your classmates and external colleagues.

## Communication Tools{-}
**Moodle Discussion Forums**: Your course may have discussion forums in Moodle to allow you to discuss ideas with your colleagues, challenging one another and analyzing key course resources. Refer to the course syllabus for assessment details, as well as the unit Assessment section for discussion questions.  

**Video Conferencing**: Your course may have scheduled online meetings (Zoom or Teams). Take advantage of these face-to-face conferences! Come prepared with your questions and assigned activities. Refer to the course syllabus and unit activity instructions for details.

*Other Options:*

Your cohort may want to engage in other informal discussions to build community and support each other.  Consider using the following:  

**Learning Cafe:** This discussion forum in Moodle is a place for you to interact about things going on, share resources, and generally get to know one another. Your posts don't have to be course related. Take this opportunity to connect with fellow learners and learn from one another!

**Flipgrid:** Flipgrid is a fun and easy way to create videos. Consider uploading a brief video introduction to share with your classmates. Discuss your hobbies, goals, and what you hope to gain from this course. Visit [Getting Started with Flipgrid](https://info.flipgrid.com/getting-started.html) for more information. Remember to click on "Join with Microsoft" and log-in using your TWU credentials. If you do not know your TWU credentials, please email [twit@twu.ca](twit@twu.ca).

**Teams:** Every TWU course has a Teams channel, mostly to manage videos. Feel free to use the messaging feature to connect with peers.

**Twitter hashtag #LDRS591:** You can tweet about this course using #LDRS591.

**What's App:** Feel free to use a platform that works for you!!  What's App is a popular chat forum that learners use for discussions, class projects, etc.


A key takeaway...make these forums work for you!  Interact with your peers, learn from each other, and make connections that will stay with you beyond this course.

With that, let's begin the journey together!
