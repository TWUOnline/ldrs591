# <!--Assignment 3:--> Scholarly Article Review #

This assignment is the next step in moving toward a literature review paper. Remember, your eventual task is to create a literature review that is synthesized from the individual research articles you have read and have taken notes on in your literature search assignment. Part of that process revolves around the need to be able to look back at your notes and quickly see what you actually noted from these articles.

To be efficient, you need to create the easiest way possible to organize the notes that you have made. Using a format that includes: (a) citation, (b) a 2-3 sentence summary, (c) key points (numbered 1-2-3-4), (d) a "So what?” and (e) a “Now what?” is the most efficient way to organize your notes.

To be transparent, these parts will be included in any literature review you write. This template allows you to easily go back - after many weeks - and see your organized notes. Then, you literally organize your notes into the order you wish to present them, cut and paste things into a new word file that becomes your literature review, and then do the final cleaning up and additions.

For this assignment, you will write a review of a journal article using the guidelines provided below. This assignment should not be any longer than **2 pages**. Note that this is rather brief, requiring you to synthesize a lot of information in a concise way, which can be challenging at first. Writing drafts of each section and then editing these to consolidate information is recommended.

#### Instructions to complete this assignment:

**Step 1:** To begin this assignment, select one peer-reviewed journal article from your literature review search assignment and provide the citation in APA 7th edition format.

**STEP 2:** Open the article review template found at the bottom of this page. Begin filling it in.

**Step 3:** Next, in 2-3 sentences summarize the purpose, problem and/or question(s). Provide a clear description of context and/or key participants and a strong summary. The summary should offer insightful comments on the article reviewed.

**Step 4:** List three to five points that you believe should be remembered. These are your choices, and could differ from person to person. They do not have to cover the entire article; focus on what you care about.

**Step 5:** This next section should be a personal reflection of where the article fits into your own thinking. It should be used to connect what you have read with what you think.

**Step 6:** Next, includes notes that help you move forward. Write a more personal summary of what you found and how these findings relate to your own needs in the research you are engaged in.  

**Step 7:** APA formatting is required for this assignment. Specifically, an APA title page, font, line spacing, margins, alignment, and paragraph indentation. Adding citations to support statements/facts made and a APA style reference. For this assignment you will also need to demonstrate clear and concise writing.
