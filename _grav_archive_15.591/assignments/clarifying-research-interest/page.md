# <!--Assignment 1:--> Clarifying Your Research Interest

The Master of Arts in Leadership program values the application of best practices to your personal and professional practice. Before we get into some of the concrete realities of accessing scholarly literature, we would like you to take time to reflect on and articulate some of the salient **leadership interests** in your personal and professional life and practice.  At the end of the MA Leadership program (in LDRS 697 & 698) you will get an opportunity to create a project based on a salient leadership problem/interest.  It is good to start thinking about what the topic may be now so that you can use the assignments in this course to start thinking about topic for your final project.

For this assignment, you will write a short 2 page paper describing your **leadership interests** (personal and/or professional).  Based on these leadership interests, you will generate research questions amenable to scholarly inquiry.

##### Steps to complete this assignment

**Step 1:** In the opening paragraph, state the salient **leadership interests** in your personal and professional life and practice. Identify **one problem** or topic that you would like to investigate and provide a brief introduction to your topic.

**Step 2:** Next, use the following three statements to help you get some clarity about what exactly you want to address in your question. If you can fill out these statements, then you most likely have a narrow enough topic with enough direction to perform some great research.

1)  I am researching ____________________________________(What? Topic)
2)  because I want to find out _________________________(So What? Issue/question)
3)  in order to ________________________________ (Now What? Application/Purpose).

**Step 3:** Identify the research question you want to pursue for your final  research paper.  Outline reasons or a rationale for why you chose this question.  Discuss why this topic is important to you.

+ If you are struggling to identify a question, consider where you see the greatest need for change in the field you want to work as a leader.  What would you propose to change in your field and why?  Consider what is working really well in your field and how could you discover best practices.

**Step 4:** APA Formatting is required for this assignment. Specifically, an APA title page, font, line spacing, margins, alignment, and paragraph indentation.

**Step 5: Upload your document to the Assignment 1 drop box in Moodle.**
