### APA Formatting Requirements:

When APA formatting is required for your assignments, here is a checklist of elements you should include for a student paper in APA 7th edition.

**General Formatting:**

*   Font: Be consistent. Use Times New Roman 12-point font, Calibri 11-point, or Arial 11-point.
*   Double-space between all text lines.
*   Leave 1-inch (2.54cm) margins at the top, bottom, right and left side of the page.
*   Indent the first line of every paragraph.
*   Use the flush-left alignment style.
*   The sequential order of the sections of my paper are: Title Page, Body of Paper, References.

**Title Page (page 1):**

*   Page number 1 is flush right in the header.
*   The title of my paper summarizes the main idea of the paper and is simple and engaging. 
*   The title is written in title case which means the first letter of any major words capitalized (4 words or greater). It is boldface, centered, and positioned in the upper half of the page.
*   My name is double spaced under the title.  It is not bold, underlined, or abnormal font.
*   The institutional affiliation is double spaced under my name.  It is not bold, underlined, or abnormal font.
*   Please provide the course number and name for which the paper is being submitted (e.g., LDRS 591), the instructors name (e.g., Dr. Heather Strong), and the assignment submission date (e.g., August 20, 2020).

**General Formatting for Subsequent Pages:**

*   Each page header has the page number flush right, all on the same line.
*   The paper title is repeated in full on the first page of the body of the paper. The title is written in title case, centered and bold. 
*   The paper is organized with appropriate headings.



| **APA 7th Headings** |                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Level                | Format                                                       |
| 1                    | **Centered, Boldface, Title Case Heading**   Text starts a new paragraph. |
| 2                    | **Flush left, Boldface, Title Case Heading**   Text starts a new paragraph. |
| 3                    | ***Flush Left, Boldface Italic, Title Case Heading\***   Text starts a new paragraph. |
| 4                    | **Indented, Boldface Title Case Heading Ending With a Period.** Paragraph text continues on the same line as the same paragraph. |
| 5                    | ***Indented, Boldface Italic, Title Case Heading Ending With a Period.\*** Paragraph text continues on the same line as the same paragraph. |

*   The introduction should not carry a heading label. 
*   Paragraphs in the body of the paper are indented 5-7 spaces or one tab stop.
*   Spacing between sentences is 1 space.
*   Lists can be enumerated or bulleted.
*   Within a single sentence for short lists use the  format, (a), (b), (c), etc.
*   For a list of sentences or short paragraphs, use a list format: 1. 2. Bullets can be used if it better describes the list but not preferred, e.g. a lot of numbers are used in the list.

**Writing Clearly and Concisely:**

*   I have not used more words than are necessary to convey meaning.
*   I have used direct, declarative sentences with simple, common words.
*   I have not used paragraphs that run longer than one double spaced manuscript page.
*   Each pronoun refers clearly to its antecedent and agrees with the antecedent in number (singular or plural) and gender.  Personal pronouns are used sparingly.
*   I have only used “we” to refer only to myself and my coauthors.
*   I have avoided using alliteration, rhyming, poetic expressions, and clichés. I have used metaphors sparingly.
*   I used the active rather than the passive voice, and I have selected tense or mood carefully.
*   I have used bias-free language.
*   I have omitted the use of slang.
*   For any numbers written in the text, I have spelled out zero through nine and the rest are Arabic numerals.
*   I used the spell check on my word processor and read through the paper carefully to catch any typos, left out words, punctuation issues, and grammatical errors.

**In-text Citations:**

* Direct quotations include the author (or title if no author), the date, and specific part of the source (page #, paragraph # or section title). For example: (Strong, 2020, p.3).

* Parenthetical citations use the author and date and they appear in parentheses for example: (Strong, 2020).

* Narrative citations are incorporated into the text as part of a sentence. The authors name appears in the text and the date appears immediately after the name in parentheses. For example, Strong (2020), has suggested that it is very important to learn the rules of APA style in scholarly writing. 

* All quotations < 40 words are enclosed in quotation marks.  The in-text citation is placed within parentheses and comes before the ending punctuation. For example: 

  "The servant-leader is servant first…It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve, to serve first. Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead" (Greenleaf, 1977, p.7).

* All quotations > 40 words are shown as an indented block quote with no additional beginning paragraph indenting.  The in-text citation is placed within parentheses and comes after the punctuation. For example: 

  ​		Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. He or she is sharply different from the person 		who is leader first, perhaps because of the need to assuage an unusual power drive or to acquire 		material possessions. For such it will be a later choice to serve – after leadership is established. The 		leader-first and the servant-first are two extreme types. Between them there are shadings and 		blends that are part of the infinite variety of human nature. (Greenleaf, 1977, p.7)

* Put commas and periods within quotation marks, *except* when a parenthetical reference follows. For example:

  He said, "I may forget your name, but I never forget a face."

  History is stained with blood spilled in the name of "civilization."

  + When a parenthetical reference follows the quote, punctuation comes after. For example,

  Mullen, criticizing the apparent inaction, writes, "Donahue's policy was to do nothing" (p. 24).

* Paraphrasing is a restatement of the original source in my own words.

* Paraphrased in text citations include the author (or title if no author) and the date. It is optional to include the specific page, paragraph, or section of a source that is paraphrased.

* For any sources with multiple authors: for one or two authors, include the authors names in every citation. For example: (Strong & Parsons, 2020)...

* For a source with 3+ authors, include the name of only the first author and put "et al." in every citation. For example, (Strong et al., 2020)...

* If the in-text citation is included in the sentence I am writing and I have multiple authors, the word and is spelled out. For example:  Jones, Smith, and Black (2010)…

* If the in-text citation is included in a parentheses an ampersand is used to separate the next to last and last authors. For example: (Jones, Smith, & Black, 2010)...

* When an author is repeated within a paragraph, with no other sources used in between, I can omit the date.  For a new paragraph, include all the elements of the in text citation per above.

**References:**

* The page title, References, is centered, 1 inch from the top of the page and starts a new page.  Standard font should be used in boldface.

* All sources listed in the References have at least 1 corresponding in text citation.

* References are listed in alphabetical order by the authors last name.

* Every reference list entry has who, when, what, and where.

* All lines are double spaced and for each entry the hanging indent is used. For example:

  Parsons, J., & Taylor, L. (2011). Improving student engagement. *Current Issues In Education*, *14*(1), 101-12. 			http://cie.asu.edu/

* Only initials are used for first and/or second names of authors.  There is a space between initials. For example: Strong, H. A.

* If there are multiple authors, they are listed in the order they appear on the original source.

* Authors in the references are separated by commas (even for 2 authors) and an ampersand is used before the last author.

* Year of publication follows the authors of the article in parentheses.

* Titles of books, journals, technical reports are given in italics, as are journal titles.

* Titles of books, journal articles, web sites are in lower case except for the first word, first word after a colon and any proper nouns.

* The title of a web page that is an article contained in a larger web site is not italicized.

* Journal article titles and book article titles are not italicized.

* Volume numbers are given in italics.

* Issue numbers are enclosed in parenthesis and not formatted with italics.

* Paging is given as a range (e.g. 45-56) without using p. or pp. except for newspapers or magazines without a volume and issue number.

* Publication information (books) includes the publishers name (no location).

* For electronic articles, a DOI is used at the end using the following format https://doi.org/XXXXXXXXXXXXX

* For electronic articles, if there is no DOI, then use the publisher’s url.

* For any citations ending with a URL all hyperlinking (blue, underline) is included and there is no period at the end of the hyperlink.

* APA Style uses two kinds of capitalization to format reference titles: title case and sentence case. APA’s title case refers to a capitalization style in which most words are capitalized, and sentence case refers to a capitalization style in which most words are lowercase.

* The titles of works that stand alone (such as a book or a report) are italicized in both the text and the reference list.

* The titles of works that are part of a greater whole (such as an article, which is part of a journal, or a book chapter, which is part of a book) are enclosed in quotation marks and written in title case.
