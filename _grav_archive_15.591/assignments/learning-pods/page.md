### Unit 2 Group Activity

In your learning pod, you will do some research on the benefits of a popular health topic (your choice).

Begin by searching for literature on your topic. Choose an article, or blog post, or video, or other internet source that you found on your topic. Determine if your source is credible or not by using the checklist below.

* **Currency** – Is the source current (<10 yrs) or out of date?
* **Relevance** - Does the information relate to your topic or answer your question? Who is the intended audience?
* **Authority – Who is the author and who published the source?**
* **Accuracy** - Where does the information come from? Is the information supported by evidence? Has the information been peer reviewed
* **Purpose** - What is the purpose of the information? to inform? teach? sell? entertain? persuade? Is the information fact? opinion? propaganda?

***As a group, prepare a short 1-page summary of your findings on the credibility of the source on your health topic. Share your findings with the class on the Unit 2 Forum.***

### Unit 8 Group Activity

In your learning pod, you will spend most of your time sharing your ideas for your action research project that you will be presenting in a group presentation. Make sure you all have time to share your project ideas.  As a group you will just choose one project to develop together and present.

**Here are the instructions for developing your action research presentation:**

Think about some practical problems that you have faced in your professional life that you would like to change. Share the problems with your group and as a group choose one that you would like to address for your action research presentation. Discuss why it is a problem and discuss why this problem is important to you. Next, you will create an idea for action research project following the steps outlined below.

1. Determine if an action research project is feasible. Remember, you want to use action research when you want to systematically address a practical problem in your work situation or community, and to advance your own professional development.
2. Specify the problem you want to study. Identify the question you want to answer. The most important factor in action research is that you need to solve a practical problem. This problem is one that you face in your own practice or in your community.
3. Identify the information that you need. This means that you need to decide who your participants will be, how many people you will study, how you will access these participants.  Be specific.
4. Describe how you will collect data.  Your choices are to collect quantitative data (e.g., attendance data, test scores, or a short survey) or qualitative data (e.g., reflection journals or in-person interviews, focus groups) or both.
5. How will you analyze the data that you collect?  Will you use quantitative, numerical data that will be examined using descriptive analyses or qualitative, text-based data using content analyses exploring general themes.
6. In action research, it is not enough to produce results from your data, you need to use those results to develop a plan for action. Describe how the results of this project will help enhance the lives of those involved.
7. Next, describe how you are going to implement your plan.
8. Finally, you also need to reflect on what you have learned from implementing your plan and discuss how you will share your results with others.

**_Note: This learning activity will be a group presentation of one action research project idea.  Post your presentation on the Unit 8 forum for peer-review._**
