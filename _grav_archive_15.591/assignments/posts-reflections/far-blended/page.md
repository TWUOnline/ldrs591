## Assignment 1: Reflection Posts ###

In an online class, discussion posts are the main way students and professors interact with the course’s ideas and lessons. The best discussion posts demonstrate an understanding of the course material and present a cohesive argument with evidence to back it up. The following tips can help you generate an effective post, to engage your classmates and elicit thoughtful responses from your instructor and classmates.

1.	Complete the assigned learning activities that are provided in each unit and complete the readings before you start writing your post. As you are reading, make connections between the text and your own life.
2.	Read the prompts carefully.  For example, what question or required reading are you being asked to respond to? What is the word limit? When is the due date and time? What sources are you expected to draw on? Are you being asked to reflect on personal experience, determine a solution to a problem, compare two ideas, or make an argument? What formatting has your instructor requested? If no specific formatting is indicated, follow general APA guidelines.
3.	Develop your thoughts and support your statements with evidence from the course materials. Be concise and articulate your ideas thoroughly.
4.	Include personal or professional experience (when it’s applicable), and support your ideas with evidence. Offer real-world application of these ideas to bring added value to the conversation and resonate with other students.
5.	Prepare your response in a word document before you post. By doing this, you’ll have a better chance to ensure the post is cohesive, coherent, and complete. Make sure to check all spelling and grammar. Just because it’s a discussion post doesn’t mean it should be messy.
6.	Post your response, engage with your classmates, and continue to ask follow-up questions. Be an integral part of the conversation and add value to what is being discussed. Some of the best online discussions continue in the minds of others long after you post to the discussion forum. So the next time you post, ask yourself: What can I write that will add value to the conversation?
7.	You do not have to reply to all of your colleagues posts. However, you should make an effort to read through your colleagues posts and respond to a minimum of two posts. Your replies should offer new substantiated ideas or thoughtful questions. Feel free to respond to more questions if you want to.


### Instructions for Reflection Posts:

Below you will find the schedule for reflection posts for each unit. Please do your best to complete the posts that require a response by Friday at midnight of the week they are assigned to allow time for your colleagues to respond to your questions over the weekend. Please post your responses on the discussion forums provided in each unit on this page.  Do not upload your response to the drop box.

>> Note. All forum posts should be between **250 (minimum) and 300 words (maximum).**

### Unit 1 Post

In unit 1, you are asked to write a post addressing the following questions:

**Part 1**
Begin by introducing yourself and explaining what your experience is with research.
Next, discuss what you have learned about the differences between informal research (everyday problem solving) and scholarly inquiry (formal research).

### Unit 8 Post

#### Part 1: Share Your Idea in a Discussion Post

Think about some practical problems that you have faced in your professional life that you would like to change.  In your discussion post,  introduce  one practical problem that you would like to address for your action research project.  Introduce the topic, discuss why it is a problem and  discuss why this problem is the one you have chosen to address.

#### Part 2: Record Your Action Research Presentation

Next, using one of the practical problems you identified from Part 1, create an idea for action research project following the steps described by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) on pp. 440-442:

1. Determine whether action research is possible in your setting and with your colleagues  

2. Specify the problem you want to study  

3. Locate resources to help you address  the problem  

4. Identify information you need to examine the problem  

5. Implement the data collection  

6. Analyze the data  

7. Develop a plan for action  

8. Implement the plan and reflect 

   

   Next, record your idea in a podcast so that it can be presented to your colleagues. Your introduction should include your key problem and explain the structure of your presentation. Your project idea should relate to a practical leadership issue you are currently facing. Your project idea should be clear and well organized. Your project should only be 3-5 minutes in length but no more than 6 minutes. Provide a conclusion that gives a call to action.

Upload your podcast to soundcloud.com, tapewrite.com, or another suitable online service and add your link the discussion forum.

**How to share your audio file:** Once you have created and uploaded your audio files share your presentation as a link in the discussion forum.

**Reminder:** Make sure you take some time to practice what you are going to say (I highly recommend creating a script) and give yourself lots of time to record, make mistakes, re-record, make more mistakes, take a break, re-record and then post it on the discussion forum.

#### Part 3: Peer Review

Finally, you are asked to peer review one Action Research project by a colleague in the class. I have posted the peer-review partnerships on Moodle under the assignments tab. For your review make notes about the strengths of the project idea as well as areas to work on (clarify, more analysis, more personal application) by using the evaluation criteria for an action research study. Here are questions you should address in your evaluation:

*   Does the project focus on a real problem in practice?
*   Does the researcher plan to study his or her own practices or plan to collaborate with community members?
*   Does the project include careful reflection about the problem?
*   Does the researcher plan to gather several sources of information (e.g., qualitative and quantitative procedures)?
*   Does the researcher develop a clear plan for addressing the problem?
*   Does the project include reflecting, thinking, looking, and gathering information and acting?
*   Will the results of the project enhance the lives of those involved?

Summarize your notes in a response to your colleagues projects and please post your review in the discussion forum. Remember that your response will be visible to all members of the class.

### Unit 9 Post

In unit 9, we have now concluded our investigation of research designs and the interpretation of the consequent research reports. In this learning activity, discuss the following question:

1.	As a consumer of research reports what were the most important aspects you need to consider in the _discussion/conclusion section_ of a high-quality research report?

### Unit 10 Post

In unit 10, you are asked to answer the following discussion questions:

In light of what you have learned in this course, respond to the following questions:

1. Why do you think evidence-based decision making is important for the Transformational Servant leader?
