### Assignment 1: Reflection Posts

As you work through the material in this course, you will be asked to submit a weekly reflection to the course instructor on the discussion forum for that week.  The reflection will be based on the work that you have completed in your learning activities.  Please note that there will be 10 reflections in total.

Generally, the weekly reflection should include the following elements:

*   A reflection on the theories, concepts, and/or strategies presented in the learning activities. Viewpoints and interpretations that are expressed are supported with clear, detailed examples.
*   Demonstrate that you have carefully read and understood the assigned readings as evidenced by your written contributions; familiarity with main ideas, and supporting evidence.
*   Each question or part of the assignment is addressed thoroughly.
*   Writing is clear, concise, and well organized with excellent sentence/paragraph construction. Thoughts are expressed in a coherent and logical manner. There are no more than three spelling, grammar, or syntax errors per page of writing

Specific instructions for the reflection posts will be provided in the unit assessments.

The purpose of reflection is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the course’s readings and learning activities. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work.

### Instructions for Discussion Posts and Responses:

Below you will find the schedule for discussion posts and responses for each unit. Please do your best to complete the posts that require a response by Friday at midnight of the week they are assigned to allow time for your colleagues to respond to your questions over the weekend.

### Unit 5 Reflection Post

In unit 5, you are asked to answer the following question:

1.	As a consumer of research reports, what are the most important elements of the _methods and results of a high-quality _**quantitative**_ research report?  

### Unit 6 Reflection Post

### Unit 7 Reflection Post

In unit 7, you are asked to answer the following question:

2.	If you were to study Transformational Servant Leadership using a mixed-methods approach, how would you conduct your study?

### Unit 8 Reflection Post

#### Part 1: Share Your Idea

Think about some practical problems that you have faced in your professional life that you would like to change.  In your discussion post,  introduce  one practical problem that you would like to address for your action research project.  Introduce the topic, discuss why it is a problem and  discuss why this problem is the one you have chosen to address.

#### Part 2: Record Your Action Research Presentation

Next, using one of the practical problems you identified from Part 1, create an idea for action research project following the steps described by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) on pp. 440-442:

1. Determine whether action research is possible in your setting and with your colleagues  

2. Specify the problem you want to study  

3. Locate resources to help you address  the problem  

4. Identify information you need to examine the problem  

5. Implement the data collection  

6. Analyze the data  

7. Develop a plan for action  

8. Implement the plan and reflect 

   

   Next, record your idea in a podcast so that it can be presented to your colleagues. Your introduction should include your key problem and explain the structure of your presentation. Your project idea should relate to a practical leadership issue you are currently facing. Your project idea should be clear and well organized. Your project should only be 3-5 minutes in length but no more than 6 minutes. Provide a conclusion that gives a call to action.

Upload your podcast to soundcloud.com, tapewrite.com, or another suitable online service and add your link the discussion forum.

**How to share your audio file:** Once you have created and uploaded your audio files share your presentation as a link in the discussion forum.

**Reminder:** Make sure you take some time to practice what you are going to say (I highly recommend creating a script) and give yourself lots of time to record, make mistakes, re-record, make more mistakes, take a break, re-record and then post it on the discussion forum.

### Unit 9 Reflection Post

In unit 9, we have now concluded our investigation of research designs and the interpretation of the consequent research reports. In this learning activity, discuss the following question:

1.	As a consumer of research reports what were the most important aspects you need to consider in the _discussion/conclusion section_ of a high-quality research report?

### Unit 10 Reflection Post
