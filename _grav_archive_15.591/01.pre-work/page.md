## Welcome to LDRS 591: Scholarly Inquiry!

### Pre-Work Introduction

This pre-work is entirely for you to prepare for your journey into Scholarly Inquiry. It is not about learning theory or terminology or specific topics. Instead, it is about your immersion in academic culture and the opportunity to discover ways in which your previous ways of knowing may be similar to or different from what you will experience in North American graduate studies. Our goal is for you to feel more confident and equipped to thrive as a scholar.

In this pre-work, we will spend some time exploring what it means to be a scholar and how academic reading and writing are really all about critical thinking. We will first explore expectations and then discuss how the purpose, audience, assignment, and critical thinking tasks shape your writing. We will read an academic article to begin to practice critical reading.

[ui-accordion-item title="Topic 1: Introduction to Scholarly Expectations"]

## Topic 1: Introduction to Scholarly Expectations

When you hear the term “essay” or “academic writing,” what comes to mind? For most people, the answer is probably grammar and strong vocabulary, and these are important, of course. But scholarly writing is much more than grammar. After all, all forms of communication require grammar in order to make sense, so what separates scholarly writing from blogs or text messages or novels? And is all academic writing the same?

No. There is no cookie-cutter.

In this topic, we are going to focus on the characteristics of academic writing in general but discuss the variables that influence your choices, such as your audience and what knowledge they share, the purpose for writing, the cognitive task, the discipline, and the genre of the assignment. We are also going to discuss how these expectations compare to your previous educational and cultural experience.

#### Activity 1: View the First Mini-Lesson, “Introduction to Scholarly Reading and Writing.”

Expectation is a key word. We all have expectations that we bring with us every day. For example, you have expectations for how your friends and family will treat you. You have expectations for how the cultural system works in your daily life, like whether it is normal to wait for people or whether it is normal for them to arrive on time. We adjust to new expectations all of the time, but this requires a period of adaptation.

Writing in the academic context requires understanding certain conventions. If you do not write in the way your professor expects, it does not matter if your paper has immaculate grammar and sophisticated vocabulary.

To experience an overview of what your professor expects, view the mini-lesson “**Introduction to Scholarly Reading and Writing.**” (_Note: This video is 30 minutes in length_)

#### Activity 2: View the mini-lesson "Defining your Audience and Purpose" and Reflect

In addition to understanding the conventions of academic writing, you will make choices in your writing based on knowing your audience and purpose.

Think about your daily communication. You probably speak to your mother differently than you speak to your friend or professor. You naturally adjust your communication based on the level of your relationship. You also consider what the other person shares with you. For example, if you and your friend watch a movie together, you can talk about the movie without explaining basic facts. However, if you want to explain the movie to a person who has not seen it, you will have to explain the background and context.

To consider how these kinds of factors influence your scholarly writing, view the mini-lesson called “**Defining your audience and purpose**.”

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/7d36e76a-b665-495e-8c6d-f4295e039473?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none;"></iframe>



Think about the norms for tone, voice, and point of view in your culture’s way of writing. How does the audience and purpose influence your communication in your culture?

#### Activity 3: View the mini-lesson “Understanding Genre and Cognitive Task”

In addition to academic conventions, audience, and purpose, you need to understand how genre and cognitive task affect your choices in your writing.

Genre means “kind” or “style.” There are many genres of film, such as comedy, action, and horror. Each genre includes certain norms.

Cognitive task means the way of thinking or the job your brain has to do. When you respond to your classmate on the forum, that is a very different cognitive task than when you evaluate a theory or interpret a case study.

Genre and cognitive task work together.

To learn about these factors in more detail, view the mini-lesson, “Understanding Genre and Cognitive Task” and then look at the resource called [“Essay Terms Explained.”](https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/ld/all-resources/writing/writing-resources/essay-terms)

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/9589a821-fa0a-4a1a-b7e4-365bda9486f9?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none;"></iframe>

#### Activity 4: View Grading Criteria and Reflect

Finally, it is important to understand how the professors will grade your work. Some people wrongly assume that if they meet the requirements of the assignment, they should get an A. However, meeting the requirements is more likely a C. Work at the graduate level must meet the professor’s expectations as we have learned, but it must also be articulate, error-free, and thoroughly researched with excellent documentation. You will learn how to use APA 7 to document all of your sources in LDRS 591.

To understand how your professor will mark your work, view the resource: [Grading Criteria in Graduate Work](https://far.twu.ca/ba-lead/ldrs399/u1/_1-6/Grading_Criteria_in_Graduate_Work.docx)

What do you notice from the grading criteria? What are the most important things to pay attention to? How are the expectations similar to and different from writing in your first culture?

[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="Topic 2: Critical Reading"]

## Topic 2: Critical Reading

As we continue, you will examine writing samples in order to understand how they have been written. This requires critical reading skills.

Basic reading includes decoding, recognizing, and processing words on the screen or page. Basic comprehension means reading to understand on a surface level. However, in graduate level work, your reading skills need to be critical.

What does critical reading mean?

Critical does not mean “criticize.” It does not mean complaining or being negative. Critical means two things:

1. Analyzing by breaking the reading down, and
2. Examining each aspect to discover assumptions, biases, gaps, and silences.

Let’s compare being a scholar to being a medical doctor. You do not want a doctor who just knows what the words and symbols mean and has memorized a lot of facts. You want a doctor who will look at everything, not just the location of pain, but the whole body. You want a doctor who will critically examine each piece of information. If your blood tests show that you have low iron, a good doctor will question this and pursue more tests to find out what other information is missing or linked.

When you read at the graduate level, you need to know how to discover the author’s argument so that you can then analyze it and question it.

Now that you have learned the expectations and variables that influence writing, you are ready to inquire more deeply.

#### Activity 5: Read and Analyze

Skim the [Gandolfi and Stone (2018) Leadership, Leadership Styles and Servant Leadership article.](https://www.lasnny.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Leadership-Leadership-Styles-and-Servant-Leadership.pdf) This means that you do not have to read all of the words or follow the details of the argument. Instead, just get a kind of feeling for the article. It’s a little like watching a movie trailer to just get a basic idea of what it is about.

Download the following document onto your computer. [Critical_Reading_Graphic_Organizer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MlNKgrmkcnWwKI_EoBHKhUz0nqdHXRyLo2LylPDhVuU/edit?usp=sharing). You should keep an empty copy of this graphic organizer in your saved files so that you can continue to use it in each unit.

**Fill in Part One of your Critical Reading Graphic** **Organizer**.

This part of the graphic organizer applies what we learned in Topic One. For each question, record your answer. There is not necessarily any one right answer. Rather, record your own opinion that comes from your reading. You might have more than one answer. For example, you might say that you think the primary purpose of the article is to forward an argument in favour of the issue but a secondary purpose is to explain a history of the topic. All analysis must be based on evidence, and the evidence comes from the reading itself. So, if you think that the author’s purpose is to argue for one side of an issue, what words or sentences gave you this impression. Record your evidence, such as the sub-headings, or some specific words that show you the author’s purpose. The evidence comes only from the article itself. In the final column, this is a chance for you to interact. You could write down an example that you have experienced or read about or you might write down some concerns or questions you have.

#### Activity 6: Read and View the Mini-Lesson “What is the author doing here?”

Now it’s time to dive into a more critical reading of the article. To prepare, read the sections of the online text: [“Reading Critically”](https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/wrd/chapter/reading-critically/) and [“Exploring the Structure of a Text.”](https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/wrd/chapter/exploring-the-structure-of-a-text/)

It can be difficult to get into the deeper layers of a reading. One helpful strategy is to try to understand the way the author has constructed the argument, which is made up of “rhetorical moves,” kind of like a chess game. To understand the idea of “rhetorical moves,” view the following mini-lesson, “**What is the author doing here**?”

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/cd2cff46-df81-44b3-b29b-6dda432701af?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none;"></iframe>

[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="Topic 3: Critical Thinking"]

## Topic 3: Critical Thinking

In everyday life, you critique or evaluate all the time. For example, you might tell your friend that the pizza you ate was delicious or disgusting, fresh or stale, flavourful or bland. Or you might talk about your experience in a course you are taking, your thoughts about a movie you watched, or whether you are satisfied with your new cell phone. These are all evaluative behaviours. When you evaluate, you provide your own individual opinion about the quality of something.

In the same way, in academic work, you will practice critical thinking about arguments, whether they are visual, textual, or spoken. We have already practiced critical thinking, where we explored conventions of scholarly work. Now, we will take this work to the next level. We will practice how to analyze and critique (or evaluate) an argument, which requires a lot of cognitive exercise. Article and book reviews are common assignments in both undergraduate and graduate work, so my goal is to help you think about how to do this well so that you can be more confident in the future. For our work in this topic, we will analyze an argument that presented through a TedTalk.

In topic 1, we learned that every kind of writing is shaped by its genre and cognitive task. In this unit, we will begin by examining and practicing the cognitive tasks of analyzing and critiquing.

Before we can evaluate or critique something, we need to break it down. This allows us to examine it more closely and discover more insights than if we just examined the whole.

**Here is an exercise: Look at your study space right now. What do you think of it?**

Your first response is probably something like, “It works for me.” Or “It’s messy.” Or “It is comfortable.” But to truly evaluate your space, try asking yourself questions like:

- Does the size work for me?
- Does the furniture work for me?
- Does the shape of the space help me focus?
- Does the room’s location work well?
- Is it noisy or quiet and how does this affect me?
- How is the lighting?
- How is the air movement? Can I breathe well?

When you begin to examine the different aspects of your study space, you create deeper thinking and may even come to a different conclusion compared to your first thought. This is the power of analysis.

The next step is critiquing. Another word with similar meaning is evaluating. When you evaluate, you **assign value to something**. You determine whether you think something is strong or weak, positive or negative. In the exercise above, after analyzing, you might determine that some aspects of a study space or more important than others, which helps you to come to a conclusion. You might decide that your room’s size and furniture are not so important, but its location and lighting really impact you. Therefore, even though your room might be small, this is not a big deal. When you critique, you give your own opinion.

Another aspect of critiquing is understanding bias. Everyone has bias. It is not a bad thing! It is human. However, we need to become aware of our own biases and how these could influence our evaluation. For instance, if my real reason to evaluate my study space is to justify spending money on new furniture, then my bias will lead me to focus a lot on all the problems with my current desk and chair and shelf and to ignore some of the other aspects of my space. If I already have a strong opinion about an issue, that is going to make it more difficult for me to evaluate fairly.

When we look at texts and arguments, we need to look for indications of bias in the authors or speakers. To do this, look for:

- strong vocabulary (such as adjectives)
- weak or missing evidence for a claim
- sweeping statements using words like *all, always, no one, never*
- silences – information, examples, or perspectives that are missing
- ethnocentrism (focus on own cultural context while ignoring others)

Let’s look at how to do this kind of thinking by understanding the broader view of a “text,” which in our course will include TedTalks (oral presentations).

#### Activity 7: Read “What is a text?”

For some brief context on what we mean by the term “text,” read this textbook’s introduction to Working with Texts: “[What is a text](https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/wrd/chapter/what-is-a-text/)?” As this short introduction shows you, the word ‘text” is not limited to written words.

#### Activity 8: View the TedTalk and Reflect

View the TedTalk, “[How great leaders inspire action](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action/transcript)” which we will use as our example for this unit. After watching, reflect on the following questions: What are your first thoughts about this talk? Write down anything that comes to mind, such as what you liked or disliked, ideas that stand out to you, cross-cultural considerations, personal experiences, etc. When you write for your pre-work, there are no limitations.

#### Activity 9: Read “Critiquing a text” and view “Walk through a critical analysis”

Now that you have watched the talk and taken some time to think about it, we will look at how to analyze and critique it.

Read your textbook’s explanation of “[Critiquing a text](https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/wrd/chapter/critiquing-a-text/)” and the Mini-lesson, “Walk through a critical analysis.”

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/7f25d155-1a8c-455b-a23b-f968f1c26a87?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none;"></iframe>

This lesson goes through the TedTalk to model the kind of critical thinking you can apply to it. Remember, though, that different people will have different ideas. Critiquing is personal, and there are no right or wrong answers, as long as you can show evidence for your opinion.

[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="Topic 4: Understanding Evidence"]

## Topic 4: Understanding Evidence

One specific aspect of any argument, especially in academic contexts, is its evidence.

For every assertion you make, you must have credible evidence to support it. Without evidence, your statement is vulnerable. You might be incorrect or you might have only partial understanding. Your statement might be valid, but without evidence, you are not credible.

For example, here is an assertion:

*Natural light is an essential feature in any study space.*

How do I know this? Well, my personal experience and feelings tell me, but is my personal feeling about it credible? No, I need evidence.

Here is a [short article](https://sustainability.ncsu.edu/blog/changeyourstate/benefits-of-natural-light/) from NC State University. Here, the writer includes explanations of the benefits of natural light and provides hyperlinks to articles and studies. This is common in journalistic writing and blogs. In your academic writing, you need to choose credible evidence and discuss it directly in your paper rather than using a hyperlink. You will learn about using APA citations to support your ideas in LDRS 591.

#### Activity 10: Study the lesson and apply

Read through the “**Kinds of evidence**” and “**Critiquing evidence**” below. Then return to Sinek’s TedTalk, [How great leaders inspire action](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action/transcript). You can click on “Transcript” to read the whole speech, which is helpful for your analysis. What kinds of evidence does Sinek include? Apply the “Critiquing evidence” questions to discover strengths and weaknesses of his evidence. Write down your ideas as you may be asked to share your analysis with your classmates or professor.

## KINDS OF EVIDENCE

- Primary source (literature, sacred texts, letters, diaries, photos, artifacts)
- Observation
- Interviews and surveys
- Historical events or documents
- Current events or documents
- Statistics/data/numbers
- Research results from a study
- Eyewitness testimony (exact words of someone who was there)
- Expert discussion (high authority)
- Agreement from others (use of several people who say the same thing)
- Forensic or scientific evidence
- Case studies
- Personal stories and experiences (called “lived experience”) from newspapers, magazines, blogs, social media, books

## CRITIQUING EVIDENCE

## General considerations

View this short video, [Evaluating Sources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=191&v=PLTOVoHbH5c&feature=emb_logo), which discusses how to choose good sources in your own work. The same principles apply to evaluating the evidence in another person’s work.

When you critique evidence in a text, consider these questions:

- What kinds of evidence does the author use? Are these kinds of evidence suitable?
- Is the evidence from a credible source?
- Is there enough evidence to support the argument?
- Is the evidence recent? Or if it is older or historical evidence, is it relevant and helpful?

If the author uses examples, current events, testimonies, or case studies as evidence, ask these questions:

- Is the story representative of the larger group? (For example, does one student’s story speak for all students?)
- Is there any bias in using this story?
- Does the story fit the context, such as the culture or situation that the author is discussing?
- If the author uses personal experience, is it relevant?
- Does the author draw reasonable conclusions from the stories? If the author uses scientific evidence or data, ask these questions:
- If the writers refer to other people’s studies, do they tell you the background of the study? Or do they just say “Research shows.” Responsible writers tell you the source of the research (either by explaining or hyperlinking).
- How old is the data and is it still relevant?
- Where was the data collected? Does the context fit the larger argument?
- Who were in the sample group for the study? Does the sample group truly represent a larger group?

[ui-accordion-item title="Topic 5: Writing the Summary"]

# Topic 5: Writing the Summary

Now that we have practiced the cognitive task of critiquing, it’s time to look at how to create the genre of a critical analysis or review.

Reviews of any kind consist of at least two parts: the summary and the critique. Sometimes your professor will ask you to include other parts, such as a personal response, a faith response, or an application to your own culture or situation. It is always important to read your professor’s assignment and follow it carefully. For now, we will write only the summary and the critique.

Why do you need a summary? Your reader needs to have some background to be able to understand your thinking. This is the job of the summary. It lays the foundation that you will build on for the rest of your essay. You do not need to try to include every idea in the original text. Rather, think about what your reader needs to know. Remember that good writing always starts with your audience in mind.

#### Activity 11: Read “Summarizing a text” and view “Writing a gist summary”

Read this textbook’s explanation of “[Summarizing a text](https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/wrd/chapter/summarizing-a-text/)” and view the Mini-lesson “Writing a gist summary.”

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/46b8e47b-fd71-49e8-964d-0b0c4b011c1c?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none;"></iframe>

[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="Topic 6: Writing the Critical Analysis"]

## Topic 6: Writing the Critical Analysis

Now we are ready to put everything together into the full paper. Like any academic paper, you will provide a short introduction and a short conclusion. In academics, your reader wants these parts to be short and direct.

Also, like all academic writing, you need a thesis statement. Your thesis statement in this genre is an evaluative sentence, one that clearly states the strengths and weaknesses you have identified.

Another common feature of the critical analysis or review is the use of headings. You don’t need a heading for your introduction because it is obvious. However, provide a heading for Summary, Critique, and Conclusion.

In this section, we will look in detail at how to structure this kind of writing and how to put your critique into paragraph form.

#### Activity 12: View “How to write a critical analysis” and reflect

View the mini-lesson “How to write a critical analysis.” Write notes to yourself about what you want to remember about this kind of writing and what you expect to be difficult for you.

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/d0f202c2-af09-4ae3-84ba-4fcddb911291?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none;"></iframe>

#### Activity 13: Write your thesis

Based on your critical thinking, determine which aspects of your critique are most significant. You can’t write about everything. Write your thesis statement and be prepared to share it with your classmates and/or your professor. Be sure to follow the teaching on how to write this kind of thesis.

Now it’s time for you to put your learning into action. Use the **Critical Reading Graphic Organizer** to analyze Sinek’s TedTalk, [How great leaders inspire action](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action/transcript).

[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="Topic 7: Writing a Reflection"]

## Topic 7: Writing a Reflection

Reflection means looking back at something and studying it carefully. Think about when you look in the mirror. You might pay careful attention to whether your hair is perfect or whether you have any food in your teeth. You look at yourself in detail.

It might seem like reflecting on your experience should be easy. After all, you do not have to read theory and find research. However, reflection is a challenging cognitive task because it requires you to look at yourself and your experiences in new ways. You have to be willing to look!

In this first section, we will discover more about what personal reflection is.

#### Activity 14: Study the lessons from Monash University

Monash University has provided a series of very short lessons on writing reflection. Although the materials are in the context of education majors, the lessons are relevant to all contexts.

Go through the lessons, which include some short exercises as well. Doing the exercises will help you think about what you are learning. The lessons are Reflective Writing in Education (the introductory lesson), The Structure of Reflective Writing, Reflecting on Learning, Description vs. Analysis, and How to Deepen the Analysis.

In these lessons, you will be introduced to Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle.

https://www.monash.edu/rlo/assignment-samples/education/education-reflective-writing

#### Activity 15: Apply these lessons to your own experience

Now you have a better idea of the kinds of thinking you need to do, so it’s time to try it. Choose one specific experience to reflect on. For example, you might choose one learning lab or one conversation with your professor or one mistake you made. Try to push yourself to reflect on it using Gibb’s Reflective Cycle. Write your ideas down. You may decide to use this work in your paper later.

[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="Topic 8: Analyzing a Reflection"]

## Topic 8: Analyzing a Sample Reflection

To understand how to write a reflection that is also very scholarly, let’s take a look at a reading. This will be the final Critical Reading Task in our pre-work.

#### Activity 16: Read Froud’s (2019) article

Froud writes about her experiences as a student in a nursing program. Although this paper is a bit different from what you will write because it is in the form of a journal article, many of the techniques she uses will apply to your work, too.

First, skim the article to get a sense of the basic topic and the structure of the paper. Highlight the key words and the transitions that help you follow her rhetorical moves.

Then read the article in more depth. https://twu.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=139907293&site=eds-live&scope=site

**Critical Reading Task:** Use your Critical Reading Graphic Organizer to analyze Froud’s personal reflection.

#### Activity 17: Writing your Reflection

The critical thinking for any paper is often the most difficult part. Having a clear structure for putting your thoughts into writing can make this a lot easier. Here we will look at the structure of a reflection paper.

Read the details below of how to structure your paper.

### Structure of a Reflection Paper

##### **Introduction**

Provide a brief (3-4 sentence) introduction to the general theme you will focus on.

Finish this paragraph with your reflection thesis statement:

[The topic of your assignment] has shown me [main theme].

Verb options:

- Leads me to discover
- Reveals to me
- Highlights my
- Gives me opportunity to see
- Has uncovered

Example:

*Returning to university has given me opportunity to see how my **confidence** has grown.*

------

##### **Background (Gibbs’ Cycle – Describe/narrate)**

Depending on what your assignment asks you to reflect on, you may need to provide a paragraph that narrates your situation. For example, if you are reflecting on a specific article, you should summarize the article. If you are reflecting on a professional experience, such as a job or a practicum, you should explain the background information about this situation. The WH questions are always a helpful guide. For our course, you do not need a background paragraph because you are responding to your experience in the course as a whole, and your professor already knows about this.

------

##### **Body sections**

Plan to have at least three body sections. Remember that a section can be made up of multiple paragraphs. Here, you have different options. Choose one and be consistent with it.

Organizational options:

- Organize by three or more different sub-themes. For example, if your main theme is “confidence,” you could then break this down into different things that influence your confidence, such as “facing challenges,” or “getting a lot of feedback.”
- Organize by different types of responses:
  - Intellectual (such as how your thinking has changed or your opinion about a specific theory)
  - Emotional (such as your reactions when you got your grades back)
  - Experiential (such as other times in your life when you have faced this)
  - Comparative (such as how what you have learned reinforces or contrasts your previous learning experiences)
- Organize using Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle, as explained in the video lesson:
  - Feelings (How do you feel about what happened?)
  - Evaluation (What are positive and negative outcomes?)
  - Analysis (What are alternative interpretations?)

##### **Paragraph structure:**

1. Write your assertion, which includes your thesis key word and your paragraph key word.  This sentence should not be a fact.

   Example:

   If your thesis the sample above...

   _Returning to university has given me an opportunity to see how my confidence has grown._

   ...then your paragraph assertion should connect a key word and add a new key word.

   _My confidence has grown through making mistakes._

2. Describe some facts about your experience. Your reader needs to understand these details in order to understand your reflection.

   Example:

   For the sentence above, I would explain one or two of my mistakes, such as…

   *For my first assignment, the infographic, I did not take the work seriously, and I did not leave enough time to do the work. I thought that one evening would be sufficient, so I waited until just four hours before the due date. However, as I began to work, I realized that this assignment required a lot of in-depth thinking and I would not be able to finish it on time.*

3. Then use a transition to show that you are going to analyze and reflect. Here are some transition words:

- I think
- In my opinion
- In my culture
- In my previous experience
- From this experience, I discovered/realized/found
- This experience showed me…
- What this taught me is…

4. Give your analysis. Be specific. Make sure you are still focused on your paragraph’s key words but **use specific details from your experience and from the course content**. Being specific and concrete is essential.

For the pre-work, you might say something like…

*I did not fully understand how much the cognitive task influences writing, so I made the mistake of thinking that I could do it quickly. In the lesson, it says, “…” but I thought that I already had a lot of ideas, so I did not pay attention. When I started…*

In other courses for other professors, you might also have a journal or you might include some interactions with your textbook, readings, group work, presentations, and experiences.

5. Write a concluding sentence if you feel that you need one. Remember that this sentence is for your audience. If your paragraph is already very clear, do not add an extra sentence that might be repetitive.

------

##### **Conclusion**

This will be a fairly short paragraph, perhaps 5-6 sentences.

Gibbs’ cycle includes these two steps, which work well as a conclusion:

- Conclusion (What could you have done differently? What other things could you have done?)
- Action plan (What are your goals?)

Remember that your professor in your other courses may have specific expectations, so always check the assignment details carefully. For instance, a professor may ask you to add a spiritual reflection or a biblical application as your conclusion.

[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="Topic 9: Write Your own Reflection"]

## Topic 9: Write your own reflection

For this final activity, the cognitive task is reflection. Look back on what you have learned in this pre-work . Here are some suggestions to get you started (but you do *not* need to answer all of these and you may have other ideas):

1. How have you yourself changed after doing the pre-work?
2. What have you learned about what it means to be a scholar?
3. What did you learn about yourself?
4. How is what you learned similar to or different from your previous writing style?
5. What was most difficult for you?
6. What did you enjoy?
7. What do you feel proud of from the pre-work activities?
8. What mistakes did you make?
9. What questions do you still have?
10. Discuss any specific concepts that have been interesting to you.

> > > Hopefully, this pre-work has given you the opportunity to prepare you for what is coming in LDRS 591. In the pre-work you have taken the time to break down your experiences and really pay attention to them. Hopefully you feel encouraged as you think about yourself at the beginning of the scholarly journey. You will continue to grow as a writer and a scholar for the rest of your life, so it is not realistic to think that if you are not happy with your development right now, it is too late. May you develop your own voice and contribute your unique perspectives and style to your next course and the next and the next.
