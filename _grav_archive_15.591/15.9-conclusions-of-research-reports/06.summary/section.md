### Unit 9 Summary

In unit 9 we have focused on assessing and interpreting the discussion/conclusion section of a research report. The discussion section is where all significant aspects of the research report are brought together in proper perspective, including relating the findings or results to the conclusions. A good discussion makes explicit how the findings or results support the conclusions.
