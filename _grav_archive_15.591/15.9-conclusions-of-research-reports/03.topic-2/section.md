### Topic 2: Comparing the Contents of Conclusion Sections of Different Research Approaches

Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) provide a helpful chart on page 472 that provides a comparison of the contents of the conclusion section for quantitative and qualitative research reports.  In common, the conclusion will report a summary of the major results or findings, a statement of comparison of the study results or findings with those of similar previous studies, a statement of the implications of the results or findings with suggestions for practice, a statement of the limitations of the study, and a concluding statement as to the overall significance of the study.  Significant differences are found in that quantitative studies explain the study results in terms of the predictions (hypotheses) discussed in the introductions, while qualitative studies "interpret their results in terms of their overall goal to explore a central phenomenon to describe its complexity and meaning" (p. 472).
