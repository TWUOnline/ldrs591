## **Unit 4 Learning Plan**

**Instructor's Notes:**

In Unit 4, the students will begin learning about the different sections of research reports and begin exploring the research on servant leadership. 

In unit 4, I begin with discussing servant leadership. Then we start right at the very beginning of a research report – the introduction. In this unit, we will unpack the three common elements in the introduction section of a research report including the research problem, the literature review and the research purpose. The learning activities are designed to allow students to evaluate the elements of an introduction section of a research report, appraising types of research problems for suitability for quantitative or qualitative studies, and examining the origin, development and application of servant leadership. 

The students will practice the evaluation process in their learning activities this week.

In my online class, students work through the unit contents, learning activities on their own time.

Unit 4 is divided into the following topics:

1. What is Servant Leadership?
2. What is a Research Problem?
3. What is a Literature Review?
4. What is the Research Purpose?

**Slides & Video Links**

I present slides 1-41 in the first part of the class.  This takes approximately 45-60 minutes. Here is a link to the [Unit 4 Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pHopgygX9WkXwvdpozs9p5QTn50m68b9/view?usp=sharing).

I also show the video ["What is Servant Leadership?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3MwqbEgUv8&feature=youtu.be) when discussing topic 1.

**In-class Learning Activities (Formative)**

During class time, I organize the students into 3-4 groups so that they can evaluate the introduction section of a research article together. Each group follows the same instructions for the learning activity (described below), but they evaluate different articles (see articles provided below). Once the evaluation is complete, students then present their evaluation to the rest of the class. I have built these learning activities into the slide presentation so that you know when I include them during the class.

**Learning Activity 4.1: Read, Evaluate, Present and Discuss**

As a group, read the introduction of an article from the Unit 4 resources to focus on to answer the questions in this learning activity.

**Part 1:** Using the evaluation criteria on page 93 of the Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) text, answer the following questions to evaluate the **statement of the problem** in the servant leadership article. The figure on page 94 of the Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) text provides a template for recording your rating and rationale. Make sure that you include your article reference, overall quality rating (0-21) and also the rationale/evidence for your rating in your presentation. 

**Part 2:** Using the evaluation criteria on page 143 of the Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) text, evaluate the **literature review** in the article based on the questions provided below. The figure on page 144 in the Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) text provides a template for your rating and rationale. Make sure that you include your article reference, quality rating (0-21) and also the rationale/evidence for your rating in your presentation.

**Part 3:** Using the evaluation criteria on page 184 or 185 of the Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) text, evaluate **the purpose** in the article. The figure on page 186 in Plano-Clark & Creswell (2015) provides a template for recording your rating and rationale. Please note that the purpose will be different for a qualitative (p.184) or a quantitative (p.185) study. See the rating criteria in Plano-Clark and Creswell for more information. Make sure that you include your article reference, quality rating (0-21) and also the rationale/evidence for your rating in your response.

Prepare a short presentation summarizing your evaluation for the class.
