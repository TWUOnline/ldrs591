## Course Description

This course provides an overview of the process, critical analysis, and associated skills required for scholarship and research. This course is designed for learners who may have little experience in the area of research, and will provide an introduction to scholarly inquiry and various research approaches being used in the field of leadership. The aim of this course is to provide learners with the skills necessary to become critical consumers, and discriminating users, of research. This course is not intended as a research methods course that will develop advanced or even intermediate skills in empirical investigation in quantitative and qualitative methods. Rather, the course provides an introductory “toolkit” that will support your work on your applied MA in Leadership activities and in your further professional work.

## **Syllabus**

The syllabus includes key information about the course schedule, assignments, and policies. Please read the full course syllabus **HERE** . 

Note that students will do part of the learning online, and part in the classroom. This is a flipped classroom model where students engage with the content at home by reading the textbook, reading and viewing the course materials on Moodle as designed by the instructor, and preparing activities and assignments for the next class. In class, they will engage in group discussions, assignments, and other activities in order to help them further engage with the course material.

For those who are new to using Moodle as the platform for your course content and for submitting assignments, then you can find information on how to navigate through this course on the tab provided [here](https://learn.twu.ca/course/view.php?id=7008&section=1).

Over this course, we will be meeting together for X hrs/ Xx per week. During our time together, I will be facilitating group discussions, answering questions, helping you with your assignments, and evaluating your participation in class.

### Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, the learner will be able to:

- Evaluate potential research questions based upon problems in the leadership domain and distinguish among appropriate methods whereby to address these questions.
- Conduct a thorough review of scholarly literature using library and internet search skills.
- Critique research studies using skills of critical-analytic thinking.
- Develop scholarly written communication skills that demonstrate higher ordered thinking and analysis.
- Demonstrate critical thinking and analytic skills characteristic of a rigorous approach to scholarship.
- Appraise the research process based upon the values and ethical standards of servant leadership.

**Please note:** This course is a pre-requisite for LDRS 697-698.

## Course Policies

## Program Grade Submission Policy

ALL course work must be submitted for final grading within 14 days following the course end date. The instructor has to submit grades to the Registrar within 14 days of the course end date. In extenuating circumstances, a provision is made for an INC to be entered pending final assignment of a course mark.

**Grading System** 

TWU’s standard grading system may be found in the academic calendar for the current year. 

In an effort to ensure consistency in the MALEAD/MAEL assignment of grades and to inform graduate students of assessments of the quality of work at the graduate level, the following interpretation of grades in assignments and courses offers a guideline.

| **Letter Grade** | **%**  | **Grade**  **Point**  **Value** | **Meaning in  Graduate Work _Note:_** *For assignments that  meet criteria in several categories, instructors will assign an average  grade.* |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **A+**           | 95-100 | 4.3                             | Exceptionally well-reasoned, compelling development  of position. Outstanding incorporation of personal vision as well as of  references and resources. Strikingly appropriate examples. Extraordinary  insight, critical analytical and evaluative ability, and creativity.  Superlative style and language usage. Makes an original contribution and is  potentially publishable. |
| **A**            | 90-94  | 4.0                             | Well-argued and convincing development of position.  Insightful incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and  resources. Notably appropriate examples. Excellent insight, critical analytic  and evaluative ability, and creativity. Impressive style and language use. |
| **A-**           | 85-89  | 3.7                             | Thorough and plausible development of position. Skilful  incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources. Very  good examples. Very good insight, analytic and evaluative ability, and  creativity. Commendable and fluent style and language usage. |
| **B+**           | 80-84  | 3.3                             | Proficient development of position. Appropriate  incorporation of personal vision as well as of references and resources.  Relevant examples. Good quality insight, analytic and evaluative ability, and  creativity. Clear and correct style and language usage. |
| **B**            | 75-79  | 3.0                             | Competent development of position, but possibly with  some gaps and/or limitations. Satisfactory incorporation of personal vision  as well as of references and resources. Satisfactory examples. Reasonable  insight, analytic and evaluative ability. Little creativity. Generally  satisfactory style and language usage, but possibly with some minor flaws. |
| **B-**           | 70-74  | 2.7*                            | Unimpressive development of position. Position not  completely consistent with personal vision *or* references and resources not taken fully into account *or* examples are basic or not  completely convincing *or* lacking  acceptable insight and analytic and evaluative ability. Style and language  usage with weaknesses (e.g., clarity, coherence, grammar). Overall quality  shows noticeable deficiencies. |
| **C**            | <70    | 2.0                             | Unacceptable work at graduate level. Shows lack of  understanding and/or competence in several of the criteria described above. *This grade is a failing grade at the  graduate level, and students receiving a “C” course grade are required to re-take the course.* |

***Note: a grade of “B-“carries a GPA of 2.7; learners require a composite GPA of 3.0 to graduate.**

**Other Designated Grades**

**INC** = **Incomplete**. A grade may be incomplete if assignments remain outstanding in a course or if the instructor has not yet submitted a grade. If assignments remain outstanding at the end of a course, students must obtain and complete an incomplete grade form from Enrolment Services.

**W** = **Withdrew**. This grade is assigned for students withdrawing during the first half of the course.

**WP /WF** = **Withdrew passing / Withdrew failing**. These grades are assigned to students withdrawing during the second half of a course. Grades are not computed into the cumulative GPA. A student may withdraw from a course only because of severe extenuating circumstances and if approval is granted by the Program Director and the Dean of Graduate Studies

### **Academic Integrity and Avoiding Plagiarism at TWU**

As scholars pursuing higher education, academic integrity is a core value of the entire TWU community. Students are invited into this scholarly culture and required to abide by the principles of sound academic scholarship at TWU. This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding all forms of plagiarism and cheating in scholarly work. TWU has a strict policy on plagiarism (see [academic calendar](file:///C:/Users/David/Documents/TWU MA-L/TWU Current/MA Lead Admin/6. 2016-2017/Syllabi templates/University Homepage > Academics > Academic Calendar > Academic Information > Academic Policies > Academic Dishonesty and Plagiarism)). Learning what constitutes plagiarism and avoiding it is the student's responsibility. Two resources describing plagiarism and how to avoid it have been prepared by TWU Librarian William Badke and are freely available for viewing [here](https://vimeo.com/163566887/bece097c99).
