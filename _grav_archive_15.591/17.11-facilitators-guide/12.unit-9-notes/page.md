## Unit 9 Learning Plan

**Instructor's Notes:**

This week, in Unit 9, the students will be reading about the common elements of a conclusion section of a research report in Chapter 14 of Plano-Clark and Creswell's (2015) text. After they have read the chapter, then you will be working through the last few servant leadership articles to evaluate and interpret the conclusions section of a research report.

The students will practice the evaluation process in their learning activities this week.

In my online class, students work through the unit contents and learning activities on their own time.

Unit 9 is divided into the following topics:

1. The Conclusion Section of a Research Report
2. Comparing  the Conclusion Section of Different Approaches to Research
3. Elements of Back Matter
4. Instructions for Assignment 4 and Assignment 5

**Slides and Video Links:**

I present slides 1-7 in the first part of the class. Theses slides discuss the conclusion section of a research report. Here is the link to the [Unit 9 Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t6BBqoxkyAUI86D-hPb_Pl90CCUhjVpN/view?usp=sharing)

The class then participates in the learning activity.

Slides 8-29 go over instructions for the final assignment (formal literature review). I spend a good amount of time explaining these assignments so that instructions are clear and the students can ask me questions. 

**In-class Learning Activities (Formative)**

During class time, I organize the students into 4 groups so that they can evaluate the conclusion section of a research article. I have built these learning activities into the slide presentation so that you know when I include them during the class.

**Learning Activity 9.1: Read, Evaluate, Present and Discuss**

As a group, read the conclusion section of an article from the Unit 9 resources to focus on to answer the questions in this learning activity.

Using the evaluation criteria on pg. 476-477 in Plano-Clark & Creswell (2015), evaluate the quality of the discussion/conclusion section in the servant leadership article. The figure on page 477 provides a template for recording your rating and rationale. Make sure that you include your article reference, quality rating (0-21) and also the rationale/evidence for your rating in your response. 

Prepare a short presentation summarizing your evaluation for the class.
