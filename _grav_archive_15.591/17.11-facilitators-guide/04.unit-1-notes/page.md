## **Unit 1 Learning Plan**

**Instructor’s  notes:** 

In unit 1, I begin the course by  spending some time introducing myself and allowing the students to introduce  themselves. Next, I provide an orientation to the course and go over expectations. Then the  students are introduced to foundational concepts related to scholarly inquiry. In particular, this unit focuses on describing scholarly  inquiry, discussing the philosophical foundations of research, exploring the  connection between leadership and scholarly inquiry, and examining what  evidence-based leadership looks like. By the end of the unit, the students  should understand the importance of the decision-making processes that they utilize in their professional  life.  The last topic covered is “significant questions”. This topic is provided at the end of unit 1  to introduce students to the process of developing a research question. This is what they will be doing in  Assignment #2: Clarifying Your Research Question.

**Unit 1 is divided into the following topics:**      

1. What is Scholarly Inquiry?       

2. Philosophical Foundations of Research

3. Leadership and Scholarly Inquiry 

4. Significant Questions 

   

**Slides  & Video links**

In the face to face class I use the powerpoint slides cover all of the  topics for this unit. Here is a link to the [Unit 1 Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zqXHEx7uMd4H7AMNHuGYnpHvNI_SOMHO/view?usp=sharing).  I have also written course content in the online course that covers the topics in this unit.  You will find all of this information online in the Moodle course. 

Throughout this unit I use a few different video resources. If the students are reading the content for the course online, then the videos are embedded into the content or into the learning activities. If I am teaching this course face to face, then I show the videos in class. Here are the video links:

**Learning  Activities**  **(Formative)**

During class time (face to face), I get the students to work in partners or groups to  discuss different questions or articles that they have read. I have built these learning activities into the slide presentation so that you know when I include them during the class.  These learning activities are also built into the online course content.

**Learning Activity #1: Partner Discussion**  

- Describe what your experience is with "research". 
- Have you  taken an undergraduate statistics course? 
- Is this your first time learning  about research? 
- Have you published your own scientific paper?  
- Discuss the differences between informal research (everyday problem  solving) and scholarly inquiry (formal research).  

**Learning Activity #2: Partner Discussion**  

- Think about your own worldview perspective.  
- What research paradigm resonates with you the most? 
- If you had to  choose one research paradigm, which one would you pick and why?  
- Do you agree or disagree with the proposition that one’s own worldview  influences the types of questions you ask, the processes that you use to find  answers to those questions?  

**Learning Activity #3: Leadership Decisions Forum Post**  

- Describe at least one example and consider all of the factors that  went into that decision-making process.   How did you make that decision? (e.g., values, research, policy, past  experience, expert opinion).  
- Create a new post under  the Unit 1 “Leadership Decisions” forum to share your decision with your  colleagues. 
- Read and respond to your colleagues posts.   

**Learning Activity #4: Video and Group Discussion**

- Watch the following video by Patton  [Introduction to Research](https://youtu.be/GYywR7SA03E) and discuss the following questions:  
- Assemble the class into small groups (3-4) and ask students to discuss in your own words, why is evidence-based decision-making important in leadership?
