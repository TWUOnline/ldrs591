## **Unit 2 Learning Plan**

**Instructor's Notes:** 

In unit 2, the students will be exploring the topic "Accessing, Utilizing and Evaluating Scholarly Literature". This unit will practically help the students become familiar with different sources of scholarly literature, searching for scholarly literature, evaluating their sources and utilizing their sources. The students should arrive in class with an idea of a research question that they would like to pursue for their first assignment. 

In my face-to-face class, I spend the first 1.5 hrs going through the slides 1-16 that talk about different sources of scholarly literature and then how to evaluate sources.  Then I spend some time on a formative learning activity that gets the students to investigate a popular topic and the scientific research that supports this topic. We then spend some time evaluating the credibility of the sources of the information they discover. In my classes, I have used the topics of the health benefits of coconut oil and celery juice. 

For the next part of the class, I have invited Qinqin Zhang (from the library) to walk the students through a very practical tutorial on accessing scholarly literature. Usually the tutorial lasts 2hrs. I would recommend that you schedule this with her before the start of your course if you would like to include it.

At the end of the day, students will upload Assignment 2: Clarifying Your Research Interest to the drop box on Moodle. I have started using the Turn it in drop boxes for this course to check for plagiarism.

In my online class, students work through the unit contents, learning activities and video tutorials on their own time.

**Unit 2 is divided into the following topics:**

1. Accessing Scholarly Literature
2. Evaluating scholarly literature
3. Utilizing Scholarly Literature

**Slides & Video Links:**

The power point slides (1-16) are what I walk students through first. Here is a link to the [Unit 2 slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1scTW1nHi5IqegJMiI3ifaLymaclsBWWs/view?usp=sharing). Then Qinqin presents slides for her library tutorial. You can access her tutorial slides [here](https://create.twu.ca/infolit/2019/07/24/summer19ldrs591/) to get a sense of what she covers.

If there is time at the end of the class then I will also cover the remaining slides (18-24) that discuss utilizing scholarly literature. This information is also covered in the required readings, so I am usually not concerned if I don’t get time to cover these specific slides.  I will usually refer students to the material in the Fredericksen and Phelps textbook that covers this information (chapter 6).

**In-class (Formative) Activities:**

During class time, I get the students to work in partners or groups to discuss different questions or articles that they have read on the topic under investigation. I have built these learning activities into the slide presentation so that you know when I include them during the class.

**Learning Activity 2.1: Group Activity & Discussion**

- In your groups, you will do some research on the health benefits of XXXX health topic. 
- Next, you will evaluate the source of the information that you discovered by providing information about the following:
- What is the origin of the health claim?
- Who is the author and who published the source?
- Is the source current or out of date?
- What is the author’s intention? Is it stated clearly?
- Has the article been peer reviewed? How do you know?
- Did the source indicate any conflicts of interest?

**Learning Activity 2.2: Library Tutorial (provided by Qinqin face to face - or there are several video tutorials provided in the online learning activities.)**

**Required Readings:** 

Frederikson & Phelps (n.d.). *Literature Reviews for Nursing and Education Students.* **Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6**
