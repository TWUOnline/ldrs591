:fa-pencil: Start a [Reflective Learning Journal](../00.reflective-journal). This journal is not submitted or graded, but is an opportunity for you to reflect on, and engage with, the course content.  The questions posed will often help you prepare for your assignments and are designed to help you successfully achieve the learning outcomes for each unit. You will find the journal located at the bottom of this page.  

**Please complete the questions for learning activity 1.1 in your reflective learning journal.**

:fa-question-circle: In your reflective learning journal, explain how you would define research.

*Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit.*
