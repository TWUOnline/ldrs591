## Introduction to the Reflective Journal

A reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. There is no correct way to create this journal; rather, it is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning. Journals can consist of traditional note taking on paper, or in a word document, you can create mind maps, pictures, or just write stream-of-consciousness, you can record your thoughts in an audio file, write down important quotes, create sketches, or drawings: whatever you choose to include. Experiment and have fun.

The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the courseâ€™s readings, activities, and discussions with your instructor and your fellow students. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work.

Throughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even outside of our scheduled course activities.

### Common Questions Used for Reflective Journaling

*   In your view, what were the most important points in the readings, videoclips, or discussions with your fellow students and tutors?
*   What information did you already know?
*   What new knowledge, ideas, or perspectives have you gained?
*   What information was easy to remember or learn? Why?
*   What concepts did you find more difficult? Why?
*   How can you apply this knowledge to your work or current experience?
*   How has this knowledge helped you to make sense of your current or previous experience?
*   Has your understanding of a personal or work-related situation changed after studying these concepts?
*   Did you agree or disagree with any of the material? If yes, how did you react and why?
*   If you could have the opportunity to engage in further learning, what would it be?
*   What further questions would like to ask the author of your readings?
*   What other articles, books or discussions would be of interest?
