### Unit 5 Summary

In Unit 5 we have explored quantitative research methods. We have learned that the methods section indicates the **overall plan** for how the research was conducted, how the data was collected, and what the analysis of the data tells us.  These sections of a research report are called the research design, method, and analysis and results, respectively.  Coming up in unit 6 we will be looking at the methods and results sections of qualitative research reports.
