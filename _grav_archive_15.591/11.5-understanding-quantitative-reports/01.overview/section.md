## Unit 5: Understanding Quantitative Research Reports
### Overview

In unit 5 we will examine the next major section of a research report: the methods and results. In this unit, we will see that the methods section indicates the overall plan for how the research was conducted, how the data was collected, and what the analysis of the data tells us. These may be termed research design, method, and analysis and results, respectively. Because of significant differences in quantitative and qualitative methods, we will break this discussion into two units. This unit will focus on the methods and results of quantitative research reports.  

### Topics

Unit 5 is divided into 4 topics:

1. Introduction to Quantitative and Qualitative Research Design
2. Quantitative Research Designs
3. Quantitative Data Collection
4. Quantitative Data Analysis and Results
