:fa-book: Next, read chapter 8, "Data Analysis and Results," in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015).

**:fa-pencil: Practice evaluating the quality of a quantitative studyâ€™s analysis and results, using the Van Dierendonck et al., article.**

Use the quality criteria discussed in Table 8.4 (Plano-Clark & Creswell, 2015) to evaluate the quality of the data analysis and results.

:fa-pencil: In your learning journal, identify what your overall quality rating is of this section and list three pieces of evidence to support your rating. Make some notes about what you would look for in a high quality "Analysis and Results" section of a quantitative research report.



*Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit.*
