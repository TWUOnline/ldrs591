:fa-book: Next, read chapter 6, "Quantitative Research Designs," in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015). 

:fa-pencil: Practice evaluating the quality of a studyâ€™s research design, using the Van Dierendonck et al., article. Use the quality criteria discussed in Table 6.3 (Plano-Clark & Creswell, 2015) to evaluate the quality of the research design. 

:fa-pencil: Finally, in your learning journal, identify what your overall quality rating is of this section and list three pieces of evidence to support your rating. Make some notes about what you would look for in a high quality "Research Design" for a quantitative research report.
