### Unit 2 Assessment

### Prepare for your Discussion

In your learning pod/discussion post, this week, you will do some research on the benefits of a popular health topic. 

Begin by searching for literature on your topic. Choose an article, or blog post, or video, or other internet source that you found on your topic. Determine if your source is credible or not. What did you find out about the credibility of your source?

Next, you will evaluate the source of the information that you discovered by providing information about the following:

* Authority – Who is the author and who published the source?
* Currency – Is the source current or out of date?
* Purpose – What is the author’s intention? Is it stated clearly?
* Publication process – Has the article been peer reviewed? How do you know?
* Bias and special interests – Did the source indicate any conflicts of interest?
