:fa-book: Next, read chapter 11, "Data Analysis and Findings," in Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015).

:fa-desktop: Next, practice evaluating the data analysis and findings of the Ragnarsoson et al., article. Use the quality criteria discussed in Table 11.3 (Plano-Clark & Creswell, 2015) to evaluate the quality of the data analysis and findings. 

:fa-pencil: Finally, in your learning journal, identify what your overall quality rating is of this section and list three pieces of evidence to support your rating. Make some notes about what you would look for in the results section of a high quality qualitative research report.

*Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit.*
