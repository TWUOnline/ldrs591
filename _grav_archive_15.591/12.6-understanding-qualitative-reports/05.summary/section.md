### Unit 6 Summary

In this unit you have learned that qualitative research has three distinct purposes:  _**to describe, to explore, and to build theory**_.  Qualitative research designs typically are less structured than in quantitative designs, and are far more flexible. The data are usually collected from a few cases or individuals so findings cannot be generalized to a larger population, but issues can be examined in great detail. Findings can however be transferable to another setting.
