### Topic 2: Leadership Decisions Revisited

In unit 1 you were asked to discuss a recent decision you made as a leader. You were then asked to think through how you made that decision. For example, did you base the decision on previous experience, values, company policy, empirical evidence or expert opinion? This course has emphasized evidence-based leadership by equipping you to access, evaluate, and apply the latest empirically-based evidence and contribute to the scholarship base in the area of leadership studies. My hope is that this course will convince you of the importance of basing your leadership decisions on the best evidence available.
