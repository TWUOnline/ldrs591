:fa-book: Next, read chapter 3, "Statements of the Problem," in the Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) text to help you understand what the statement of the problem is and what to look for in a high-quality article. 

**:fa-pencil: In your reflective learning journal, practice evaluating the quality of a studyâ€™s statement of the problem of the Eva et al., article.**

Use the quality criteria discussed in Table 3.1(Plano-Clark & Creswell, 2015) to evaluate the quality of the statement of the problem. 

:fa-pencil: Finally, in your learning journal, identify what your overall quality rating is of this section and list three pieces of evidence to support your rating.

*Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit.*
