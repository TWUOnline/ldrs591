## Unit 4 Assessment

## Prepare for your Discussion

In your learning pod/discussion post this week, you will read the **introduction section** of Eva et al., (2019) [Servant leadership: A systematic review and call for future research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2018.07.004).  While you read the introduction, you will evaluate it using the criteria provided in the Plano-Clark and Creswell text: for the statement of the problem, the literature review, and the research question/purpose.

**_You will prepare a short summary of your evaluation and post it on the Unit 4 forum._ _Remember to provide the title of your article in your summary._**
