:fa-book: Next, read chapter 5, "Purpose Statements and Research Questions," in the Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) text.

:fa-desktop: Practice evaluating the quality of a studyâ€™s purpose statement/research question, using the Eva et al., article. Use the criteria discussed in Table 5.7 (Quantitative) or Table 5.8 (Qualitative) (Plano-Clark & Creswell, 2015) to evaluate the quality of the research question/purpose statement. 

:fa-pencil: Finally, in your reflective learning journal, identify what your overall quality rating is of this section and list three pieces of evidence to support your rating. Make some notes about what you would look for in a high quality "Purpose Statement and/or Research Question".

*Note that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit.*
