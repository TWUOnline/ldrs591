## Unit 8: Action Research: Studies that Solve Practical Problems
### Overview
We want to shift our focus from the highly theoretical and rigidly structured forms of formal research that we have considered thus far and look at a form of research that you are more likely to employ as a leaderâ€”action research. Action research has evolved as a method well suited to leadership and organizational studies as well as in educational settings. In unit 8 we will explore how action research is related to, and yet distinct from, other forms of research that we have explored to date. If formal research approaches (qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods) are aimed at generating new knowledge, action research is aimed at finding solutions to local problems and issues.  

### Topics

Unit 8 is divided into 3 topics:

1. What is Action Research?
2. The Action Research Method
3. Evaluating An Action Research Study



### Learning Outcomes

When you have completed this unit you should be able to:

1. Identify a practical problem that can be addressed with action research.

2. Design an action research project that might be utilized in your leadership practice.

3. Evaluate an action research project proposal.
