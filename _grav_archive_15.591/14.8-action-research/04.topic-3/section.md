### Topic 3: Evaluating An Action Research Study

According to Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015):

> Action research has gained support across many disciplines including education, nursing, and clinical work. \[However\], some view it as an “informal” process of research, conducted by practitioners who are not formal academic researchers.  Action researchers typically report results of their studies in informal venues, such as conferences, websites, or local groups in the community. Hence, the design may not have the rigor and systematic approach found in other designs. However, it is precisely this flexibility and responsiveness that makes action research studies among the best source of information to learn about potential solutions to real problems because they are conducted in real professional settings by real practitioners. Therefore, when evaluating an action research study, you need to keep in mind the intent and standards for this particular form of research. (pp.443-444)
