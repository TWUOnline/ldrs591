:fa-exclamation: Next, think about some practical problems that you have faced in your professional life that you would like to change. 

:fa-pencil: In your reflective learning journal, list three problems that matter to you and that you think you can systematically address in your work situation. After reflecting on these problems, select one that you would like to address for your action research project.

> > > > Note.  The following learning activity will be created in groups during class time.  For asynchronous learners, your action research presentation may be completed individually.

:fa-video-camera: In this learning activity, you will create an idea for an action research project based on one of the practical problems you have identified from your professional life. You will present this project idea in a PPT, audio recording or video for your colleagues. 

This learning activity is intended to be informal, so do not spend too much time planning and researching your topic. Please note that if you are sharing confidential information from your place of employment that you should change the name of your employer or any people involved.

##### Instructions:

1. Using one of the practical problems you identified above, create an idea for an action research project following the steps described by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) on pp. 440-442.

2. Put a presentation together and record your presentation so that it can be presented to your colleagues for feedback.

3. Your introduction should include your key problem and explain the structure of your presentation.

4. Your project idea should relate to a practical leadership issue you are currently facing.

5. Your project idea should be clear and well organized.

6. Your project should fit within 3-5 minutes but no more than 6 minutes (8 slides maximum).

7. Provide a conclusion that gives a call to action.

8. Upload your presentation to another suitable online platform and post a link to your presentation on the Unit 8 discussion forum.

   

**Reminder:** Make sure you take some time to practice what you are going to say (I highly recommend creating a script) and give yourself lots of time to record, make mistakes, re-record, make more mistakes, take a break, re-record and then post it on the discussion forum.

_Note this learning activity is ungraded._
