#### Learning Activity 8.3 - Peer-review an Action Research Project

Next, you will peer review one Action Research project by colleagues in the class. Note: You will not be able to do this until everyone has posted their presentations in the Unit 8 forum. 

I have posted the peer-review partnerships in Moodle under the assignments tab. This means that you will be assigned to peer-review one of your colleagues presentations. For your peer-review make notes about the strengths of the project idea as well as areas to work on (clarify, more analysis, more personal application) by using the evaluation criteria for an action research study outlined by Plano-Clark and Creswell.

Here are the questions you should address in your evaluation:

1. Does the project focus on a real problem in practice?
2. Does the researcher plan to study his or her own practices or plan to collaborate with community members?
3. Does the project include careful reflection about the problem?
4. Does the researcher plan to gather several sources of information (e.g., qualitative and quantitative procedures)?
5. Does the researcher develop a clear plan for addressing the problem?
6. Does the project include reflecting, thinking, looking, and gathering information and acting?
7. Will the results of the project enhance the lives of those involved?

Summarize your notes in a response to your colleagues project and please post your review in the Unit 8 Discussion Forum as a reply on their post. Remember that your response will be visible to all members of the class.  

_Note. This activity is ungraded, but gives you an opportunity to provide formative feedback for your colleagues._
