# Welcome to LDRS 591!

# Scholarly Inquiry!
_____________

&nbsp;

### Course Description

This course provides an overview of the process, critical analysis, and associated skills required for scholarship and research. This course is designed for learners who may have little experience in the area of research, and will provide an introduction to scholarly inquiry and various research approaches being used in the field of leadership. The aim of this course is to provide learners with the skills necessary to become critical consumers, and discriminating users, of research. This course is not intended as a research methods course that will develop advanced or even intermediate skills in empirical investigation in quantitative and qualitative methods. Rather, the course provides an introductory “toolkit” that will support your work on your applied MA in Leadership activities and in your further professional work.

## Course Policies

### Academic Dishonesty Policy

One of the core values of Trinity Western University is the integration of high standards of personal, moral, and spiritual integrity with academic excellence. As such, the University considers it a serious offence when an individual knowingly acts, or fails to act, in a manner to gain unearned academic credit. It is the student’s responsibility to inform him or herself as to what constitutes academic misconduct, and to address any questions to the individual professors with whom he or she is dealing.

!! It will be assumed that you have read, understand, and agree to the information provided at the 'Academic Dishonesty Policy' button below. If you have any questions at all please contact your instructor.

### Late Assignments Policy

Assignments should be submitted on the due date in order to receive full credit. The penalty for unexcused late assignments will be determined by the following scale:

1. For each day or part thereof late, the instructor will reduce the assigned grade by one- third of a letter; e.g., “A” to “A-,” “B+” to “B.”
2. Requests for extensions **must be communicated in advance** of the due date. Special circumstances may warrant additional consideration.
3. No late papers will be accepted beyond a week after the due date.


### Attendance & Class Participation Policy

To ensure consistent participation for classes in the MA LEAD/MAEL programs, it is important for all learners to maintain regular attendance to scheduled face-to-face class times. Missing class time in a face-to-face class hinders learning and the success of those enrolled (individuals/ teams) in MA LEAD/MAEL courses.

To ensure learner success in the program, learners missing two class sessions* or more will:

1. Not be allowed to remain in the course.

2. Be required to take the course again.

3. Be unable to attend further classes for the course in the same semester.

_Note:_ Students in online courses are expected to participate in discussion forums and group assignments as directed in Moodle. Forum participation in online courses is a significant part of the course final grade.


### Program Grade Submission Policy

ALL course work must be submitted for final grading within 14 days following the course end date. The instructor has to submit grades to the Registrar within 14 days of the course end date. In extenuating circumstances, a provision is made for an INC to be entered pending final assignment of a course mark.
