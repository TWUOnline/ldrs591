# **Facilitators Guide**  

Welcome to LDRS 591! This guide will give you an overview of the course, including the course syllabus, suggested facilitation strategies, and instructor notes. Please also review in detail the course contents in Moodle. Another key resource for every Facilitator is the TWU Faculty instructor of record. Please ensure you have set up a meeting weeks before the class begins.

In this guide, I will outline a couple of key ideas to consider as you facilitate this course. See below for advice on setting up your class schedule, facilitating activities and discussions, and guiding students through assessments.

This course is organized into 10 units. Each page of the course will provide you with the following information:

- A general overview of the topic that will be addressed during the unit.
- Specific learning outcomes and topics for the unit.
- Resources that you will need to address learning activities and assessments in the unit.
- Learning activities that you will need to complete each week.
- Assessments pages will provide you with information about assignments that you will need to complete each week

During the course, you will be hosting Facilitated Learning Labs at a designated FAR Centre location. During lab times, as course facilitator, you will be guiding group discussions, answering any questions learners may have, helping learners understand the assignments, and evaluating their participation in labs as specified by the LDRS 591 Participation Rubric.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask. We are here to bring clarity, provide encouragement and supportive connection alongside you and the learners on this blended-learning journey.
