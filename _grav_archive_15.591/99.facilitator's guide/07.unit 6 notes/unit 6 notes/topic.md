## **Unit 6 Learning Plan**

**Instructor's Notes:**

In unit 6, the students will be exploring **qualitative research methods**. This unit emphasizes qualitative research designs, data collection, and data analysis and findings. The students will practice the evaluation process in their learning activities this week.

In my online class, students work through the unit contents, learning activities on their own time.

Unit 6 is divided into the following topics:

1. Qualitative Research Design
2. Qualitative Data Collection
3. Qualitative Data Analysis and Findings

**Slides & Video Links**

I present slides 1-24 in the first part of the class.  Here is a link to the [Unit 6 Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kkrgm0J3mQI-Jmbt8f7uJT0-ogTPSxVB/view?usp=sharing).

**In-class Learning Activities (formative):**

During class time, I organize the students into 4 groups so that they can evaluate the methods and findings section of a qualitative research article (see articles listed below). I have built these learning activities into the slide presentation so that you know when I include them during the class.
