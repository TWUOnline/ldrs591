# Unit 5 Learning Plan

**Instructor's Notes:**

In unit 5, the students will be exploring the next major section of a research report: The methods and results section. In this unit, we will see that the methods section indicates the overall plan for how the research was conducted, how the data was collected, and what the analysis of the data tells us. In unit 5, we will be looking at the methods and results sections of quantitative research reports. I usually remind the students that we are *reviewing* these materials in order to become an *informed critical consumer of research*, rather than experts in statistics.

The students will then practice the evaluation process in their learning activities this week.

In my online class, students work through the unit contents, learning activities on their own time.

**Unit 5 is divided into the following topics:**

1. Introduction to Quantitative and Qualitative Research Design
2. Quantitative Research Designs
3. Quantitative Data Collection
4. Quantitative Data Analysis and Results

**Slides & Video Links**

I present slides 1-38 in the first part of the class.  Here is a link to the [Unit 5 slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18zAhHU6-oHKsRa5x-rqAbvSBbYD9ZWoi/view?usp=sharing).

I show [Not all scientific studies are created equal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUpd2HJHUt8) video by David H. Schwartz on slide 11.

I describe one of my dissertation studies on slides 13-20 as an example of an experimental research design. You may want to substitute one of your own quantitative studies to use as an example in this unit.

I use the Khan Academy video “[P-values and significance tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS6KEWaoOOE)” at slide 34 to explain statistical significance.

Then I have the students watch a video clip from Netflix movie Prediction to show how statistics are used in real life. We only watch from minute 20-30.

**In-class Learning Activities: (formative)**

Then during the second part of class, I organize the students into 4 groups so that they can evaluate the methods and results section of a quantitative research article on the topic of servant leadership (see articles provided below). I have built these learning activities into the slide presentation so that you know when I include them during the class.

**Learning Activity 5.1: Read, Evaluate, Present and Discuss**

As a group, read the methods and results section of the article that you have bene assigned below to answer the questions in this learning activity.

Articles for Group Evaluation:

- Barbuto, J. E., Gottfredson, R. K., &     Searle, T. P. (2014). An Examination of Emotional Intelligence as an     Antecedent of Servant Leadership. *Journal of Leadership & Organizational Studies, 21*(3), 315–323. https://doi.org/10.1177/1548051814531826
- Cerit, Y. (2009). The effects of servant leadership behaviours of school principals on teachers' job     satisfaction. *Educational Management Administration and Leadership, 37*(5), 600-623.
- Jenkins, M., & Stewart, A. C. (2010). The importance of a servant leader orientation. *Health Care Management     Review, 35*(1), 46-54.
- Van Winkle, B., Allen, S., DeVore, D., & Winston, B. (2014). The relationship between the servant leadership     behaviors of immediate supervisors and follower's perceptions of being empowered in the context of small business. *Journal of Leadership Education, 13*(3), 70-82.

**Part 1:** Using the evaluation criteria on p. 211 in Plano-Clark & Creswell (2015), complete the following questions to evaluate the **research design** in a quantitative research report in the servant leadership article you chose. The figure on page 212 provides a template for recording your rating and rationale. Make sure that you include your article reference, quality rating (0-21), and also the rationale/evidence for your rating in your response.

**Part 2:** Using the evaluation criteria on p. 249 in Plano-Clark & Creswell (2015), complete the following questions to evaluate the **participants and data collection** in a quantitative research report in the servant leadership article you chose. The figure on page 250 provides a template for recording your rating and rationale. Make sure that you include your article reference, quality rating (0-21) and also the rationale/evidence for your rating in your response.

**Part 3:** Using the evaluation criteria on pp. 278 and 279 in Plano-Clark & Creswell (2015), complete the following questions to evaluate the **data analysis and results** in a quantitative research report in the servant leadership article you chose. The figure on page 280 provides a template for recording your rating and rationale. Make sure that you include your article reference, quality rating (0-21) and also the rationale/evidence for your rating in your response.

Prepare a short presentation summarizing your evaluation for the class.
