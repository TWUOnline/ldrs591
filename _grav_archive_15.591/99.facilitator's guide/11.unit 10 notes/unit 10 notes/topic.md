## Unit 10 Learning Plan

**Instructor's Notes:**

In unit 10, the students will be bringing things to a close through several experiential learning activities.

For the learning activities, the students will be revisiting a question about making informed decisions, discussing why evidence-based decision-making is important for the Transformational Servant Leader, and writing a reflection on what their expectations are for upholding the integrity of a research report.

Unit 10 is divided into the following topics:

1. Issues of Credibility
2. Leadership Decisions Revisited

**Slides & Video Links**

I begin by presenting slides 1-7 in the first part of the class. Here is the link to the [Unit 10 Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w8tXGJMCIlD8e91JRlPVJgf6AUHwtQym/view?usp=sharing)

Then we watch the Ted Talk by Ben Goldcare “[Battling Bad Science](https://www.ted.com/talks/ben_goldacre_battling_bad_science)”

I continue with slides 8-16. This is followed by large group discussion (Learning Activity 10.1).

Finally end with Learning Activity 10.2

**In-class Learning Activities (Formative)**

**Learning Activity 10.1: Reflect and discuss in partners.**

After watching the Ted talk by Dr. Ben Goldcare, take a few minutes to discuss the following questions with the partner beside you:

- How can I know that I can trust what I am reading?
- How do I know the research has been performed competently?
- How do I know the research is reported honestly?
- How do I know the findings presented are consistent with what other     researchers would conclude?

**Learning Activity 10.2: Reflect and Discuss (large group)**

Would you make your decisions differently after taking 591?

**Required Readings**

None
