<h3>Bringing It All Together</h3>

<h3>Overview</h3>

“So I turned my mind to understand, to investigate and to search out wisdom…” (Ecclesiastes 7:25)

Scholarly research reports can have profound impact on society.  Thus far in this course we have been making the case that best practices are informed by the wise and judicious application of research findings to particular situations.  Don’t miss the importance of adverbs “wise” and “judicious.”  Plano-Clark and Creswell tell us that we should “read research to learn new knowledge about topics, to become informed on policy debates, and to find suggestions for improving your practice” (2010, p. 15).  In unit 10 we will be bringing things to a close through several experiential learning activities.

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ol>
<li>Evaluate the safeguards that are in place to uphold the integrity of the research process.  </li>
<li>Critically reflect on the importance of evidence-based decision making for transformational servant leadership.  </li>
<li>Create a critical literature review.</li>
</ol>
