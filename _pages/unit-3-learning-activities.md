This week in Unit 3 you will be discovering how to develop your professional scholarly voice, specifically through your scholarly writing.  This means that you will be reading content that will help you understand that there are different writing styles that are used in the world of academia and how important it is to use APA style in the MA Lead program.

Your learning activities this week are focused on applying the APA standards for general aspects of writing, mechanics of writing and citing sources.  You will also get to apply these skills in assignment 3 which is your scholarly article critique, and then continue to practice them in assignment 5.
<h3>Developing Your Professional Voice</h3>
When you are asked to write a scholarly paper in graduate school, what you are really being asked to do is to develop your professional voice (McDonald, 2011). A professional voice can be described as utilizing formal language, good vocabulary and appropriate tone in your written and oral communication (Walden University Writing Center, 2017). Characteristics of a strong professional voice are writing concisely, with clarity and precision, and appropriately citing your sources (McDonald, 2011).

Developing your professional voice is important because some students will turn their papers into professional manuscripts that will be submitted to a journal or a book. Some students may be asked to present their work at a professional conference. McDonald suggests that "for most students, writing papers in graduate school is an exercise in presenting important information in an easy to understand and concise way" (p.125).

A well developed professional voice can also benefit you in your professional context. For example, at work you may be asked to write a briefing document for your school or hospital board, or you may be asked to share your ideas with other professionals at a conference, or you may be asked to write a grant to fund your organizations new project. These are just three examples of professional situations where it is important to have a well-developed professional voice so that you can communicate in a clear and concise way.

In order to communicate well, you need to have a system to organize your thoughts so that the information you are writing is presented in an organized and clear manner. There are a wide variety of publication styles that are employed today in universities and in scholarly publications. A few that you may be familiar with are Chicago style, MLA style, Turbian style and APA style. The American Psychological Association (APA) has developed a writing style that is used to establish a standard of written communication. This standard includes: the organization of content, writing style or writing mechanics, citing references, and how to prepare a manuscript for publication in certain disciplines (APA, 2010). The MA Leadership program uses the APA Manual (6th edition) as the model for formatting written work formally submitted.

Aside from simplifying the work of your instructors by having everyone use the same format for a given paper, using APA style makes it easier for readers to understand a text by providing a familiar structure they can follow. Abiding by APA's standards as a writer will allow you to:
<ol>
 	<li>Provide readers with cues they can use to follow your ideas more efficiently.</li>
 	<li>Provide readers with dates of publications to help them locate current information that may be of interest to them.</li>
 	<li>Allow readers to focus more on your ideas by not distracting them with unfamiliar formatting.</li>
 	<li>Establish your credibility in the field by demonstrating an awareness of your audience and their needs as fellow researchers.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Learning Activity 3.1 - Read, Watch and Reflect</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>In this learning activity you will begin by reading chapter 1 of the APA manual and also the Appendix of the Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) text.</li>
 	<li>Next, watch the following video tutorial  "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZEXIve3hu0">Writing in Psychology</a>" by Dr. Mark Hatala.  In the video Dr. Hatala explains the importance of learning APA style for writing in the behavioural and social sciences.</li>
 	<li>Next, in your reflective learning journal, discuss your previous experience with APA style and why you think scholarly writing can be important for you as a leader in your context.</li>
 	<li>Note that these questions make up Part 1 of your <strong>XXX</strong> assignment for this unit.  See Unit 3 Assessment for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is Scholarly Writing?</h3>
According to Heady (2013), graduate-level (or scholarly) writing is "clear, correct and concise, but it adds the elements of originality and discipline specific expertise" (p. 2). Heady suggests that graduate-level writing explores a topic or a research question in an original way, demonstrates extensive research done on the topic, has a strong organizational structure, and is written for a professional audience. The scholarly writer writes in a way that is skillful, engaging and organized well so that the paper moves from point to point allowing the reader to follow in a logical progression. Heady also states that "a good paper has a clear and obvious structure: you can enter it through a clear, well-composed introduction, you move from section to section, and you exit where you know you have been and what you have seen" (p. 73).
<h3>Structure and Organization</h3>
Writing a scholarly paper often follows a very distinct organizational structure and includes: a title page, an introduction, methods and results, a discussion and a list of references. Let's take a closer look at what should be included in each of these sections of a scholarly paper.

<strong>Title Page:</strong> This is the first page of your paper and it should include a title that summarizes the main topic you will be discussing. It should also include your name (the author), and the institution you are affiliated with (Trinity Western University). It is also helpful if you include the date that you are submitting the assignment.

<strong>Abstract:</strong> This the second page of your paper. The purpose of the abstract is for the author to to convey the sentiment of the study in a concise yet informative manner. The abstract is used to determine if the reader is interested in the article and wants to retrieve the article for further information. In 250 words, the abstract explicitly states the overall problem and research question, a brief description of the method, a summary of the findings and important conclusions.

<strong>Introduction:</strong> The purpose of an introduction is to inform the reader of the rationale for your research topic. It should provide a brief overview of the "problem" that you are addressing by providing a broad context, any relevant statistics and describing the importance of your topic. The introduction is also the place where you can define any important terms that may be unfamiliar to the reader and ends with establishing what the key purpose for the paper is. The purpose can be stated as your research question.

<strong>Methods:</strong> The methods section outlines specifically what procedures the author chose to do. In a research report this section will include the sampling methods, sample size, measures, research design, and interventions used. The methods section of a research report looks very different than a methods section of a literature review. In a literature review, the methods section will emphasize how you chose the articles and how you evaluated the articles you reviewed. This will include describing any inclusion or exclusion criteria, the databases that were searched, what key search terms were used, how many records were obtained and how many articles were included in the review. You can refer to Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) on page 20 or to the APA (2010) manual on page 29 for a more detailed explanation of the methods section.

<strong>Results:</strong> The results section reports the findings of the data analysis of a research report or the critical analysis of a literature review. Please refer to Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) and APA (2010) for extensive detail about the results of different empirical research reports.

<strong>Discussion:</strong> In the discussion section, the authors describe their own interpretations of the results and link these interpretations back to the literature that was reviewed. In this section the author may discuss the strengths and limitations of the literature, draw conclusions, and make recommendations for future research on the topic.

<strong>Reference List:</strong> The reference list provides a precise list of all of the sources you cited within your paper.
<h3>Learning Activity 3.2 - Read, Watch and Practice!</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>In this learning activity you will read chapter 2 and pp. 228-230 (section 8.03) of the APA (2010) manual which discusses the structure and content of an APA style manuscript or paper.</li>
 	<li>Next, watch the following video tutorial "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGhNzgcjFXI&amp;t=379s">Manuscript Structure and Content</a>" by Dr. Mark Hatala.  In the video Dr. Hatala explains discusses the structure and content of an APA style paper.</li>
 	<li>Next, watch the following video by Purdue Owl on "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdAfIqRt60c&amp;list=PL8F43A67F38DE3D5D">APA formatting the basics</a>". This video shows you how to set up your title page and other pages in APA style in a word document.</li>
 	<li>Practice your skills by creating a title page and second page in an APA formatted word document. Your title page should include a title, running head, author byline, institutional affiliation, and page number (see p. 229 in the APA manual under the heading "order of manuscript pages").</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Write a Scholarly Paper</h3>
To begin writing a scholarly paper you need to have a research topic in mind.  Then you need to do a review of scholarly literature to obtain a good working knowledge of your topic and then critically evaluate and synthesize the literature you have read.  Finally, you need to have an organizational system for presenting what you know about the research topic. The APA (2010) manual provides a clear organizational structure for presenting scholarly information.

When you begin writing, it is important to remember that you are communicating ideas about a topic to a specific audience.  In order to convey your ideas well, you need to write clearly and concisely with set of specific guidelines.  This is important for two reasons: to keep your reader's attention and to make sure your meaning is clear.  If your writing is long-winded, you will either lose the interest of your reader or confuse your reader.  When your writing is more concise and clear, this will motivate your reader to pay attention to what you have to say.

There are also times when you are writing with a specific purpose in mind. For example, to prepare an assignment or a board briefing document.  Writing clearly and concisely helps a writer communicate what needs to be said in an efficient and effective way.  It is also easy to understand and helps the writer connect with the audience.  Here is an excellent resource by the Purdue Owl Writing Center on "<a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/english_as_a_second_language/esl_students/tips_for_writing_in_north_american_colleges/index.html">Tips for Writing in North American Colleges</a>".  This website is full of helpful resources to help you improve your scholarly writing.
<h3>Learning Activity 3.3 - Read, Watch and Practice!</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>In this learning activity you will read chapter 3 and 4 of the APA (2010) manual which discusses writing clearly and concisely and the mechanics of APA style.</li>
 	<li>Next, watch the following video tutorials  "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRu1UPPubMY">Writing Clearly and Concisely</a>" and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SXTfLLzmt4">The Mechanics of Style</a>" by Dr. Mark Hatala.  In the videos Dr. Hatala discusses the importance of writing clearly and concisely and the APA guidelines to ensure clear, consistent presentation of ideas.</li>
 	<li>Next, practice your skills by completing the following quiz <strong>[Hi Kelly - I need to figure out how to make a quiz for this LA]</strong></li>
 	<li>In your reflective learning journal, make note of the elements of APA style writing that you struggle with and need to improve on for your next assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Citing the Ideas of Others</h3>
Within each section of a scholarly paper, each paragraph utilizes a combination three types of content: claims, evidence and transitions. Heady states that "claims are the points you want to prove, interpretations you want to offer, and assertions you want to make, whereas, evidence is the material you use to back up your claims" (pp. 74-75). Some examples of types of evidence that may be used to support claims include: "quotes from a book, citations from an article, data from a study, personal experience, historical facts, statistics, etc. Transitions are one or two words that help you move from one claim to another" (pp. 74-75).

An example of the three types of content (claims, evidence and transitions) included in a paragraph of scholarly writing is provided below from the article "A Systematic Literature Review of Servant Leadership Theory in Organizational Contexts" by Parris and Peachy (2013, pp. 377-378):
<blockquote>Over the years, some leadership scholars have called attention to the implicit connection between ethics and leadership. A burgeoning new research area and leadership theory that has been linked to ethics, virtues and morality is servant leadership (Graham 1991; Lancot and Irving 2010; Parolini et al. 2009; Russell 2001; Whetstone, 2002). Despite servant leadership being coined by Robert K. Greenleaf over three decades ago in 1970, it remains understudied yet prominently practiced in boardrooms and organizations (Bass and Bass 2008; Spears 2005).</blockquote>
From the example above, you can see that a topic is introduced in the first sentence. A claim with supporting evidence is provided in the second sentence (with references) and the transition begins in the third sentence with the word "despite". The third sentence also includes a claim with supporting evidence (references). This paragraph structure is typical of what you would find in scholarly writing. Scholarly writing involves putting your own thoughts and ideas (claims) in context by ensuring that you are citing the ideas of those who have influenced you (APA, 2010, p.169).

Heady (2013) suggests five general rules you should always follow when you are organizing your paper (p. 80):
<ol>
 	<li>You must provide enough background information to give your reader a good working knowledge of your topic.</li>
 	<li>Your background information must lead logically to your research question.</li>
 	<li>All claims/ideas/facts must be backed up by evidence.</li>
 	<li>All evidence must be related to a claim/idea/fact.</li>
 	<li>If evidence does not back up a claim, you need to explain why and/or account for it.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Learning Activity 3.4 - Read, Watch and Practice!</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>In this learning activity you will read chapter 6 of the APA (2010) manual which discusses plagiarism and giving credit to sources in APA style.</li>
 	<li>Next, watch the following video tutorial "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImX4SlPCH3c">Crediting Sources</a>" by Dr. Mark Hatala.  In the video Dr. Hatala discusses the importance of properly citing sources in APA format.</li>
 	<li>Next, practice your skills by completing the following quiz <strong>[Hi Kelly - I need to figure out how to make a quiz for this LA]</strong></li>
 	<li>In your reflective learning journal, make note of the elements of citing sources that you struggle with and need to improve on for your next assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reference Lists</h3>
The reference list provides a precise list of all of the sources you cited within your paper. APA (6th edition) has many rules to follow for correct formatting of references (see chapters 6 and 7). In general, the APA manual states "when in doubt, provide more information rather than less. Because one purpose of listing references is to enable readers to retrieve and use the sources..." (p.193).
<h3>Learning Activity 3.5 - Blog post</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>In this learning activity you will watch the following video tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjNALjxisC4&amp;t=3s">"Reference Examples"</a> by Dr. Mark Hatala and consult the reference examples provided in chapter 7 of the APA manual.  In the video Dr. Hatala discusses the different elements required for, and examples of, references in APA style.</li>
 	<li>Next, practice your skills by creating a reference list in APA format for six different scholarly sources (on any topic). The sources you should include in your reference list are as follows:
<ul>
 	<li>A journal article (7.01)</li>
 	<li>A book or book chapter (7.02)</li>
 	<li>A government report (7.03)</li>
 	<li>A blog post (7.11 #76)</li>
 	<li>A doctoral dissertation or master's thesis (7.05)</li>
 	<li>An online newspaper article (7.01 #11)</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>In your reflective learning journal, make note of the elements of the references that you struggled with and need to improve on for your next assignment.</li>
</ul>
