### Assignment 2: Developing Your Research Question (15%) {.unnumbered}

In this assignment, you will describe your leadership interests (personal and/or professional) and generate research questions amenable to scholarly inquiry.

The Master of Arts in Leadership program values the application of best practices to your personal and professional practice. MA Lead is founded in Greenleaf’s (1977) servant leadership which has 10 characteristics:

1.  Listening
2.  Empathy
3.  Healing
4.  Awareness
5.  Persuasion
6.  Conceptualization
7.  Foresight
8.  Stewardship
9.  Commitment to the growth of people
10. Building community

Take time review these characteristics, their meaning and significance in leadership practices. Then reflect on and articulate some of the salient leadership interests in your personal and professional life and practice. Here are some brainstorming questions to help guide you:

-   What problem do you see in your workplace that needs to be addressed?
-   What specific aspects of your leadership style do you find most challenging, and why?
-   What are your personal, academic, and professional goals?
-   Where you see the greatest need for change in the field you want to work in as a leader?
-   Consider what is working well in your field and how could you discover best practices? What is not working well? How can it be improved or changed?

After identifying some salient leadership interests, consider which servant leadership characteristics are most relevant to your topic.

**Instructions**

Write a **two-page paper (excluding title page and references)** describing your leadership interests (personal and/or professional). Describe which servant leadership characteristics are most relevant to your research interest (no more than two characteristics). Based on these leadership interests, generate a research question that will guide your scholarly inquiry.

**Include the following sections in your paper in APA 7 format:**

1.  **Title Page**
2.  **Introduction**: In the opening paragraph, state the salient leadership interests in your personal and professional life and practice. Identify one problem or topic that you would like to investigate and provide a brief introduction to your topic.
3.  **Servant Leadership**: Write 2-3 paragraphs describing which servant leadership characteristics are **most** relevant to your research interest (no more than two competencies). Explain why they are relevant to your research interest.
4.  **Research Topic**: Next, include the following three statements to clarify what you want to address in your question. If you can complete these statements, you will have a narrow enough topic, with enough direction, to perform some great research.
    -   I am researching \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (What? Topic)
    -   because I want to find out \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (So What? Issue/question)
    -   in order to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Now What? Application/Purpose).
5.  **Research Question & Rationale**: Write the research question you want to pursue for your capstone project. Write a 2-3 paragraph rationale for why you chose this question. Discuss why this topic is important to you.
    -   Be sure your Research Question (RQ) is formatted as a question.
    -   Check your RQ to be sure it is specific and that it can be answered through research. **Be aware that you will likely refine your research question by the end of this course.**
6.  **References**: Include an APA 7 formatted reference list.

*APA 7: Be sure to use APA formatting for all in-text citations and references.*

### Assignment 4: Research Letter of Intent (15%) {.unnumbered}

In this assignment you will demonstrate your scholarly inquiry learning by writing a research letter of intent (1 page excluding title page and references). The letter of intent is suitable for thesis track proposal or reframing in LDRS 697/698 as a systematic literature review.

Before you begin LDRS 697/698, you must choose a capstone or thesis track. Your options are:

-   Capstone: Conduct an extensive Systematic Literature Review (secondary research).
-   Thesis Track: Conduct primary research.

After choosing option 1 or 2, write a one-page (plus title page and references) letter of intent, explaining which option you choose. In the letter of intent, you will briefly describe the background of your research problem, your research question, and proposed methods. Be aware you must have approval from your professor to pursue the thesis track.

**Instructions**

Write a one-page letter of intent including the following:

1.  **Background of the Research Problem:** Short paragraph, building an argument based on the literature and your personal/professional experience, regarding why this is an important research study. This can be a succinct summary of what you’re learned in your scoping literature review.
2.  **Research Question:** clearly state your revised research question.
3.  **Proposed Methods:** Include a short, detailed, succinct description of how you plan to gather and analyze data (thesis track: primary research) or capstone (systematic literature review), to answer your research question. Explain why the option you chose is best suited to answer your research question.
4.  **Conclusion:** Summarize why this study matters, your RQ, and the methodology you will use to answer this RQ.
5.  **Reference Page**

*As always, be sure to use APA 7 formatting for all aspects of this paper, including Title Page, Tables, Citations, and Reference List.*
