    "section": "1.1 What is Scholarly Inquiry?",
    "text": "1.1 What is Scholarly Inquiry?\nInquiry is “the process of developing skills to arrive at understandings of a problem, an issue, or a phenomenon, through the process of asking good questions, searching out good evidence, and arriving at well-reasoned conclusions” (Penner, 2017).\nBy now you are well aware of the applied nature of the Master of Arts (MA) in Leadership program. This feature may be an important part of what attracted you to the program. Why, then, study research methods? Why worry about scholarly inquiry? This course in scholarly inquiry will help you develop systematic thinking skills applicable in all realms of leadership and everyday life. As Rosch et al. (2023) note, research focuses professional knowledge to inform your leader-centric, group-centric, and context-centric concepts, guiding the broader view of your leadership position and contributing to your overall leadership practice (p. 23). Moreover, your leadership practice is ideally evidence-based; that is, based on evidence derived from systematic scholarly inquiry.\nIndigenous (Canada’s First Peoples) knowledge systems offer a complementary perspective to scholarly inquiry by emphasizing relational, holistic, and ethical dimensions of knowledge. Unlike Eurocentric models that often compartmentalize knowledge, Indigenous inquiry focuses on the interconnectedness of all living things and aims to achieve harmony between people, the environment, and spirituality. As Battiste (2005) explains, Indigenous methodologies prioritize ethical relationships and community well-being, filling gaps in mainstream research by addressing the moral responsibilities of researchers.\nFor example, when Indigenous scholars ask questions, they often consider their impact on future generations and the environment. This approach enriches traditional inquiry by integrating ethical considerations into the process of evidence-gathering and analysis.\n\n1.1.1 Activity: Exploring Research as Inquiry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Plano-Clark and Creswell (2014), “research is a process of steps used to collect and analyze information in order to increase our knowledge about a topic or an issue” (p.4) and it is different than informal research.\n📺 Watch the following video “Research as Inquiry” from Bertrand Library at Bucknell University (2023) that gives an overview of research as inquiry:\n\n\n\n📖 Read Chapters 1 and 2 in in Introduction to Research in Leadership (Rosch et al., 2023).\n✏️ Start a Reflective Journal. This journal is not submitted or graded, but is an opportunity for you to reflect on, and engage with, the course content. The questions posed will often help you prepare for your assignments and are designed to help you successfully achieve the learning outcomes for each unit.\nNext, write about the following in your Reflective Journal:\n\nHow would you define research?\nDescribe your experience with “research.”\n\nHave you taken an undergraduate statistics course?\nIs this your first time learning about research?\nHave you published your own scientific paper?\n\nHow might relational approaches to inquiry change the way you frame research questions?\nHow can integrating ethical considerations into research contribute to leadership practices?\n\nNote: Your Journal is not graded but will help you in your assessment for this unit.",

    "section": "1.2 Leadership and Scholarly Inquiry",
    "text": "1.2 Leadership and Scholarly Inquiry\nOn what basis are sound decisions made? What evidence do leaders rely upon for best outcomes? The need to evaluate evidence for best practices in leadership decision-making is widely acknowledged. Patton (2002) observes that “the emphasis on knowledge generation disseminated in the form of best practices has swept like wildfire through all sectors of society” (p. 329).\nThe MA in Leadership program emphasizes a vision of best practices in leadership. What do is meant by this? Put simply, “best practices” refers to those practices and initiatives that result in the best possible outcomes. What qualifies something as best practice? Identifying best practices starts by understanding the common sources of evidence available to leaders.\nTake a moment to think about a recent decision you made as a leader. On what did you base this decision? Previous experience? Values? Company policy? Empirical evidence (e.g., data derived from research)? Expert opinion? Systematic inquiry, as represented by research, is one tool that leaders can use to inform best practices and their decision-making process.\nSystematic inquiry is hardly new; first century writings demonstrate Bible evidence of systematic, logical, and empirical inquiry.\nConsider the following passage from Luke, a physician trained in empirical methods of his day:\n\nMany have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught (The Bible, New International Version, 2011, Luke 1:1-4).\n\nHow does the research process differ from managerial activities such as decision-making and problem solving? Research shares with decision-making and problem-solving the systematic and disciplined procedure of identifying an issue or problem, deciding on an approach, formulating a plan, collecting and analyzing data, drawing conclusions, and implementing decisions based on this rigorous process. What distinguishes research from generic or everyday problem solving is its commitment to advance or generate knowledge that typically will be communicated to the larger academic or scientific community. Since the beginning of the 21st century, there has been remarkable growth in the foundations of research and research methodologies across the natural, applied, and social sciences, as well as the humanities.\n\nBoyer’s Model of Scholarship\nThe MA in Leadership program is focused on applied scholarship. In defining this, Boyer’s four-part Model of Scholarship (1997, as cited in Nibert (n.d.)) is useful. Boyer’s typology identifies four domains of scholarship: discovery, integration, application, and teaching. Marta Nibert (n.d.) discusses the model in her paper titled “Boyer’s Model of Scholarship.”\nIn the section titled “Application,” Nibert (n.d.) notes that the scholarship of application:\n\nfocuses on using research findings and innovations to remedy societal problems. Included in this category are service activities that are specifically tied to one’s field of knowledge and professional activities. Beneficiaries of these activities include commercial entities, non-profit organizations, and professional associations (para. 4).\n\nThough Nibert’s primary audience is the professoriate, this material is relevant for MA Leadership learners. Application is highlighted because this program was designed to focus on the scholarship of application, although work in the capstone will likely include one or more of the other domains.\n\n\nScholarship of Discovery\nBoyer’s Scholarship of Discovery is the type of scholarship associated with traditional scholarly research. “Research is a systematic process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting information (data) in order to increase our understanding of a phenomenon abut which we are interested or concerned” (Leedy & Ormrod, 2010, p. 2). Boyer’s Scholarship of Discovery is often referred to as primary research. Primary research is narrowly focused and contributes to the body of knowledge by helping people understand one isolated part of reality in detail in the hopes that this understanding can be generalized to a broader part of reality. In traditional research, the Scholarship of Discovery falls into two distinct genres: quantitative and qualitative research. Each of these genres manifest in numerous variations, including hybrid models involving both quantitative and qualitative elements, designed for and suited to differing research questions.\n\n\nScholarship of Integration\nBoyer’s Scholarship of Integration is “the attempt to arrange relevant bits of knowledge and insight from different disciplines into broader patterns that reflect the actual interconnectedness of the world” (Boyer, as cited in Jacobsen & Jacobsen, 2004, p. 51).\nThe Scholarship of Integration often involves interdisciplinary collaboration and requires critical analysis and review of knowledge, followed by the creative synthesis of ideas to address specific topics or issues.\n\n\nScholarship of Application\nThe Scholarship of Application is “the scholarship of engagement; seeking to close the gap between values in the academy and the needs of the larger world” (Boyer, as cited in Jacobsen & Jacobsen, 2004, p. 51). In the Scholarship of Application, knowledge is applied to the solution of societal needs and practice. In most cases, knowledge stemming from the Scholarship of Discovery and the Scholarship of Integration informs the solutions to problems. These scholarships are often associated with the context of formal education. Although the Scholarship of Application may happen within formal education contexts, it is most often associated with other settings (Boshier, 2009, p. 6).\n\n\nScholarship of Teaching\nFinally, the Scholarship of Teaching is “the scholarship of sharing knowledge” (Boyer, as cited in Jacobsen & Jacobsen, 2004, p. 51). The Scholarship of Teaching involves the reflective analysis of the knowledge about teaching and learning. This knowledge base itself is the product of the Scholarships of Discovery, Integration and Application combining as “active ingredients of a dynamic and iterative teaching process” (Boshier, 2009, p. 5). Boyer’s typology originally identified as the Scholarship of Teaching has expanded and is now widely known in literature as the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (Boshier, 2009).\nBoshier contends that Boyer’s four domains were conceived holistically as elements that overlap and interact, not as discrete elements, appearing in any predictable order, and are better viewed as an operating system than a list of discrete elements (Boshier, 2009, pp. 4–5). As such, it is helpful to view the model as a Venn diagram where each scholarship domain overlaps (see Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Boyer’s Model of Scholarship\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLDRS 591 is designed to help you understand types of research, identify a research topic, develop a research question, and decide whether you will pursue a thesis track in your MA Leadership studies. Should you choose the thesis track, you will engage in Scholarship of Discovery, meaning you will conduct primary research.\nNote: Choosing the thesis track requires approval from the Department of Leadership Program Director.\nMost program students choose the capstone track, in which they conduct secondary research.\n\n\n1.2.1 Activity: Applying Research to Leadership Decisions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📺 Watch the following video “Introduction to Research Design” from Research & Doctoral Services at Walden University (2015) where Dr. Patton introduces the concept of research as a scholar-practitioner:\n\n\n\n✏️ Respond to the following in your Reflective Journal:\n\nDescribe at least one example of a decision you have made as a leader.\nConsider the factors that went into that decision making process (e.g., values, research, policy, past experience, expert opinion).\nWhat do you consider as “evidence” in your decision making?\nIn your own words, why is evidence-based decision-making important in leadership?\n\nNote: your Journal is not graded but will help you in your assessment for this unit.",

    "section": "1.3 Philosophical Foundations of Research",
    "text": "1.3 Philosophical Foundations of Research\nA professor once observed that a fundamental attribute of being human is the tendency to ask questions. Humanity is especially interested in three fundamental questions:\n\nWhat is real?\nWhat is true?\nWhat is good?\n\nThe philosophical category of metaphysics is concerned with what is real, and what is the nature of reality. The philosophical category of epistemology is concerned with the truth, and the nature and process of knowing. The philosophical category of axiology is concerned with what is good and how people can determine the nature of goodness. Much of history is a chronicle of the different ways people have answered these three fundamental questions. How people answer these questions reveals their perspective and worldview.\nEvery person bases their own thoughts, decisions, and actions on what is called a worldview. A worldview is “an interpretive framework through which one makes sense of themselves, other people, and the world around them” (Geisler & Watkins, 2003). It is like a pair of glasses that you wear when you are observing things about yourself, other people, and the world in which you live.\n📺 Watch the following short video “What’s Your Worldview? (Quiz)” by the Impact 360 Institute (2014) that explains the concept of worldview:\n\n\n\nA discussion about worldview, or your perspective, is foundational to what you want to accomplish in this course.\nThroughout this course you will continuously consider:\n\nOn what basis are sound decisions made?\nWhat evidence do leaders rely upon for best outcomes when they are making decisions?\n\nEach person has a preference for obtaining truth or a framework for understanding ourselves, others, and the world, and personal preferences abound. Researchers and consumers of research approach knowledge, learning, and life with a particular perspective. Understanding that perspective is essential before beginning the research journey and is especially important in leadership roles.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Research Paradigms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40670-019-00898-9 (Brown & Dueñas, 2020)\n\n📺 Watch the following helpful video “Ontology, Epistemology, Methodology and Methods in Research Simplified!” by Laura Killam (2015) that explains Paradigms, Ontology and Epistemology:\n\n\n\nIt is important to be aware of your worldview before you enter the research journey because it will inform the types of questions that you ask and the processes that you use to find the answers to your questions.\nAs an example, review this Christian worldview and explore how it can be applied to the research journey:\nA Christian worldview asserts that God has created the world and everything in it, and that truth is arrived at through a study of God’s specific revelation (the Bible) and general revelation (creation). Christians believe not only in studying and understanding truth, but they also believe in a personal God that has revealed Himself through this created world.\nThe Christian worldview can be summarized in three words: Creation, Fall, and Redemption. Consider what these terms mean in the context of worldview. Initially, when God created the world, it was all good, whole, and harmonious. God created man in His own image. Originally man was created healthy in body, soul, and spirit (The Bible, New International Version, 2011, Genesis 1:26-27, 31). As people rebelled against God, causing the Fall, the presence of sin corrupted all aspects of God’s good creation, and brought about much suffering. Where there was formerly harmony and wholeness, we now experience ourselves, our relationships, and the world around us as fractured, broken, and full of dis-ease (a literal discomfort with who we are) (The Bible, New International Version, 2011, Genesis 3).\nDespite the brokenness, Christians believe that God is actively working to bring about restoration and wholeness to His entire creation. Through Christ’s redemptive work on the cross, people are reconciled to God and are challenged to make all things as they were created and meant to be–very good. Redemption means that all things are made new in Christ(The Bible, New International Version, 2011, Colossians 1:19-20).\nThe framework of Creation, Fall, and Redemption is important because it allows people to enter a discussion about research with confidence knowing that God’s redemptive work touches this area. Christians believe that we are called to study creation with the desire to take the knowledge we gain and use it to help and bless others; to work toward the restoration and healing of God’s creation. Christians are called to inquire, investigate, and ask questions, always with a view to serve others.\nAnother example of a worldview is an Indigenous worldview, which grounds reality, truth, and goodness in relational and interconnected terms. For example, drawing from Battiste (2005) and Menzies (2001), Indigenous philosophies often emphasize that reality is inherently interconnected and inseparable from the land, community, and spirituality (metaphysics). This relational understanding challenges individualistic approaches to research. Further, Indigenous ways of knowing prioritize collective experience, oral traditions, and lived knowledge passed down through generations (epistemology). Knowledge is not only “discovered” but also co-created and shared with respect to its cultural and environmental context. Finally, from an Indigenous perspective, what is “good” is often framed as what sustains harmony and well-being within the community and environment, making ethics a central consideration in the research process (axiology).\nAs Menzies (2001) explains, incorporating Indigenous perspectives into research requires rethinking the researcher’s role, emphasizing reciprocity, mutual respect, and the co-creation of knowledge with the communities involved.\nNote: It is beyond the purpose of this course to go deeper into this topic other than to make the point that our way of knowing and understanding the world around you—your worldview—influences how you approach all of life, including how you approach research and how you use research to inform your decision-making process.\n\n1.3.1 Activity: Exploring Your Worldview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📺 Watch the following video where Gary Gramenz (2013) explains “Philosophical Foundations for Research Methodology”:\n\n\n\n📖 Read “Servant Leadership: A Worldview Perspective” (Wallace, 2007).\n📖 Read “A Medical Science Educator’s Guide to Selecting a Research Paradigm: Building a Basis for Better Research” (Brown & Dueñas, 2020).\n✏️ Reflect on your own worldview. Then answer the following in your Reflective Journal:\n\nWhat motivates you? What are you driven by? (e.g. funding, social justice, the common good)\nDo you believe there is “one verifiable reality,” or that “multiple socially constructed realities” exist?\nIn what ways can your research contribute to the well-being of the communities you are studying?\nWhat do you think counts as knowledge within the world?\nHow do you think knowledge is acquired?\nBased on the Brown and Duenas article, what research paradigm resonates with you the most? (i.e., positivist, post-positivist, social constructivist, critical theory). Why does it resonate with you?\n\nNote: your Journal is not graded but will help you in your assessment for this unit.",

    "section": "2.1 Quantitative Research",
    "text": "2.1 Quantitative Research\nThe purpose of reviewing these materials is to become informed consumers of research, rather than to develop expertise as researchers. This unit gives a brief introduction to the quantitative and qualitative research methodologies.\nPlano-Clark and Creswell (2015) assert that quantitative and qualitative research approaches are suited to various kinds of research questions: a quantitative research approach is indicated when the research problem requires explanation, while a qualitative research approach is indicated when the research problem requires exploration.\nFrom a Christian perspective, becoming an informed consumer of research is deeply connected to the biblical call to seek truth, act justly, and serve others. Research is not merely a technical exercise or a pursuit of knowledge for its own sake; it is a means to align our actions and understanding with God’s purposes. Colossians 3:23 states, “Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men,” and reminds people that diligence and integrity in all tasks, including engaging with research, are forms of worship and service to God (The Bible, New International Version, 2011).\nTo be an informed consumer of research from a Christian perspective means approaching inquiry with humility, recognizing that all truth ultimately comes from God—John 14:6: “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” This perspective calls people to critically evaluate the methodologies, assumptions, and conclusions of research, ensuring they align with ethical principles and the pursuit of justice (“To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God,” Micah 6:8.) For instance, quantitative methods may help you uncover patterns that inform fair policies, while qualitative methods allow you to listen deeply to the voices of traditionally marginalized individuals.\nAdditionally, research can be viewed as an act of stewardship, in which people responsibly use the knowledge, resources, and abilities God has entrusted to them to benefit others and bring glory to Him (“Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms.” 1 Peter 4:10.) Engaging with research critically and ethically ensures that your efforts do not exploit or harm but instead contribute to human flourishing and the common good.\nFinally, becoming an informed consumer of research also requires discernment. Christians are called to weigh information carefully and assess its validity (“But test everything; hold fast what is good,” 1 Thessalonians 5:21) This discernment helps people navigate biases, incomplete evidence, or conclusions that may conflict with Christian values. By doing so, you uphold the integrity of our faith while embracing research as a tool to seek knowledge, promote justice, and serve God’s purposes in the world. This commitment to discernment extends beyond personal reflection and academic study. It also plays a crucial role in leadership, where decisions often have significant impacts on others. Leaders are called to apply the same thoughtful evaluation to the research they use in their professional roles.\nLeaders often face complex situations that require thoughtful decisions grounded in credible evidence. For example, in an educational leadership context, a school principal may review research on different instructional models to determine which approach improves student engagement and achievement. By carefully evaluating the research methods and findings, the principal can select strategies that are both evidence-based and appropriate for the school’s unique community and goals. This ability to assess and apply research ensures that leadership decisions are thoughtful, ethical, and effective.\nLearning to evaluate research equips you to make well-informed choices, apply findings responsibly in your organization, and lead with integrity and confidence. This skill will support you throughout this course and in your leadership practice, particularly as you work toward completing your systematic literature review project.\n\nQuantitative Methodology\nLeedy and Ormrod (2010) assert that quantitative research has three purposes: to explain and predict, to confirm and validate, and to test theory. Rosch et al (2023) stated quantitative research is a process of describing relationships with numbers: “The central presumption of quantitative research is that concepts can be represented by numbers” (Rosch et al., 2023, p. 81).\nAccording to Rosch et al. (2023), quantitative research is a structured method of inquiry that emphasizes measurement and analysis of numerical data to understand relationships, behaviors, and outcomes. Further, quantitative research is an approach that seeks to establish patterns and test hypotheses through rigorous statistical techniques. Quantitative research often begins with a clear hypothesis derived from theory or prior research. Further, quantitative research uses statistical tools to interpret data and validate hypotheses. Hypotheses are evaluated through methods such as surveys or experiments. For example, structured surveys can yield quantifiable data that researchers analyze to draw conclusions about leadership effectiveness or organizational dynamics (Rosch et al., 2023).\nQuantitative research aligns with the Christian commitment to stewardship and truth-seeking. The Bible emphasizes the importance of seeking understanding and using it wisely—Proverbs 2:6: “For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.”. Researchers are encouraged to approach data analysis with integrity, ensuring that their work serves the greater good and aligns with ethical principles that prioritize the well-being of others.\nIn summary, quantitative research is a vital approach in the study of leadership, offering a systematic way to collect and analyze data, test theories, and derive insights that can inform leadership practices and strategies. Through structured methodologies and statistical rigor, it provides a foundation for understanding complex relationships and informing decision-making.",

    "section": "2.2 Qualitative Research",
    "text": "2.2 Qualitative Research\n\nQualitative Methodology\nIn contrast to quantitative research, qualitative research has three distinct purposes: to describe and explain, to explore and interpret, and to build theory (Leedy & Ormrod, 2010). These differing research purposes find expression in differing research processes, the kinds of data gathered, the approaches to data analysis, and finally in the ways findings are communicated.\nCounter to quantitative research, qualitative research is a method of inquiry that focuses on understanding complex phenomena through the collection and analysis of non-numerical data, such as words, images, and experiences. In Chapter 8 of Introduction to Research in Leadership, Rosch et al. (2023) describe qualitative research as an approach that seeks to explore the depth and richness of human experience, particularly in social and organizational contexts.\nBecause qualitative research focuses on human experiences, it resonates strongly with Indigenous approaches to knowledge, which prioritize relationships, context, and interconnectedness. Menzies (2001) emphasized that Indigenous methodologies often involve storytelling, oral traditions, and respect for the lived experiences of participants. Researchers are encouraged to adopt a relational approach, viewing participants as co-creators of knowledge rather than subjects of study. This perspective ensures that research benefits the community and the academic field, embodying principles of reciprocity and respect.\nTo explore human experiences, qualitative research often involves conducting interviews, focus groups, or content analysis, which allow researchers to gather insights into participants’ perspectives, experiences, motivations, and emotions. Qualitative research is particularly valuable in leadership studies, as it captures the nuances of individual and group dynamics that quantitative methods might overlook.\nAdditionally, a key feature of qualitative research is its flexibility; researchers can adapt their methods as new insights emerge during the study. Rosch et al. (2023) note that this adaptability enables a deeper understanding of the context in which leadership occurs. The authors also highlight the importance of reflexivity, encouraging researchers to reflect on their own biases and influences throughout the research process.\nIn summary, qualitative research provides a rich and detailed understanding of human behavior and organizational phenomena, making it an essential tool for exploring the complexities of leadership and decision-making.\nThe differing designs of quantitative and qualitative research lead to marked differences in how data are analyzed. Quantitative data is approached primarily through deductive reasoning, employing statistical analyses applied to numerical data, with stress on objectivity. In contrast, qualitative data is approached primarily through inductive reasoning with the goal being to uncover themes and categories, with acknowledgement of potential researcher bias and subjectivity. Typically, quantitative research findings are reported in a formal, scientific style with full display of numbers and statistics, while qualitative research findings are typically reported in a narrative form (Leedy & Ormrod, 2010). Table 2.1 shows the similarities and difference between quantitative and qualitative research.\nTable 2.1.

    "section": "2.3 Mixed Methods Research",
    "text": "2.3 Mixed Methods Research\n\nMixed Methods Methodology\nMixed methods research combines quantitative and qualitative approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena. Rosch et al. (2023) describe mixed methods as a strategy that leverages the strengths of both methodologies, allowing researchers to explore questions from multiple perspectives.\nMixed methods research involves collecting and analyzing both numerical data and non-numerical data, which can enrich the findings and offer deeper insights. For example, researchers might use quantitative surveys to identify trends and patterns, followed by qualitative interviews to explore the meanings and experiences behind those trends. This approach enhances the validity and reliability of the research, as it provides a more holistic view of the subject matter (Rosch et al., 2023).\nMixed methods research reflects the biblical principle of seeking wisdom through multiple sources (“Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers, they succeed,” The Bible, New International Version (2011), Proverbs 15:22). Combining quantitative and qualitative insights mirrors the Christian commitment to balance and thorough understanding in addressing complex issues.\nRosch et al. (2023) also highlight the importance of integrating the findings from both methods to create a cohesive narrative that informs leadership practices and theories. This reflects the biblical principle of seeking wisdom through multiple sources, as Proverbs 15:22 states, “Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers, they succeed.” Combining quantitative and qualitative insights mirrors the Christian commitment to balance and thorough understanding in addressing complex issues. By employing mixed methods, researchers can address complex questions that cannot be fully understood through a single methodological lens.\nIn summary, mixed methods research is a powerful approach in leadership studies, facilitating a multifaceted exploration of issues and contributing to a richer understanding of organizational dynamics and human behavior.\n\n\n2.3.1 Activity: Comparing Research Approaches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📺 Watch the following videos:\n\n“Qualitative & Quantitative Research – An Introduction” by Tine Juhl (2017).\n\n\n\n\n\n“What is Mixed Methods Research?” by Michigan Medicine.\n\n\n\n\n✏️ Reflect.

    "section": "2.4 Literature Reviews vs Systematic Literature Reviews",
    "text": "2.4 Literature Reviews vs Systematic Literature Reviews\nLiterature reviews serve as foundational tools for understanding the breadth and depth of existing research on a topic. They help scholars identify gaps in knowledge, establish a framework for future inquiry, and situate their work within broader academic conversations. This section explores traditional literature reviews, systematic literature reviews (SLRs), and scoping reviews, highlighting their differences and uses.\n\nLiterature Review\nWhether or not you realize it, you may have read literature reviews in your studies to date.\nBy definition, a literature review examines and evaluates published work related to a specific subject. In some cases, it focuses on research from a particular time frame. Rather than simply summarizing sources, a literature review follows a structured approach that blends summary with synthesis. While a summary highlights the key points from each source, synthesis involves reorganizing and integrating that information to present new insights or connections among the studies (Mastrodonato, n.d.).\nRosch et al. (2023) highlight that a traditional literature review is often narrative and subjective, summarizing existing research without adhering to a strict methodology. Traditional reviews may lack comprehensive search strategies and systematic analysis, leading to potential biases in how studies are selected and interpreted.\nAdditionally, Cherry et al. (2023) identified the primary functions of literature reviews as summarising, classifying, and critically evaluating, which help inform researchers about what has been done and what remains to be explored about a particular topic.\nRosch et al. (2023) emphasize that literature reviews play a crucial role in research, particularly in fields like leadership, by offering insights into theoretical frameworks, methodologies, and practical implications. Literature reviews help researchers situate their work within the broader academic discourse and can guide future research directions.\nAdditionally, peer-reviewed studies consistently highlight the importance of literature reviews in establishing a foundation for new research by summarizing existing work, identifying gaps, and guiding future inquiry (Cherry et al., 2023). Literature reviews play a crucial role in research, particularly in fields like leadership, by offering insights into theoretical frameworks, methodologies, and practical implications (Rosch et al., 2023). This flexibility can lead to biases in how studies are selected and interpreted, particularly when search strategies and analyses are not comprehensive.\nFrom a Christian perspective, engaging with literature reviews reflects the biblical call to stewardship and the pursuit of truth. By thoughtfully analyzing and synthesizing previous research, scholars fulfill their responsibility to use knowledge wisely, align their work with ethical principles, and serve the greater good—Colossians 3:23: “Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men.” The narrative nature of traditional literature reviews aligns with this stewardship by encouraging researchers to thoughtfully engage with existing knowledge while remaining diligent and accountable in their efforts—Proverbs 21:5: “The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance.”\nMoreover, literature reviews can be understood as a form of storytelling, resonating with Indigenous methodologies that value relationality and interconnectedness (Battiste, 2005; Menzies, 2001). For Indigenous scholars, storytelling is an essential practice for weaving together diverse knowledge sources, preserving their integrity, and situating them within a broader relational context. Traditional literature reviews parallel this practice by connecting past knowledge to current and future inquiry, ensuring that the voices and perspectives within the research are acknowledged and respected.\n\n\nSystematic Literature Review\nWhile traditional literature reviews provide a flexible narrative overview, more structured approaches, such as systematic literature reviews (SLRs), emphasize rigor and reproducibility.\nA SLR is a comprehensive and structured approach to evaluating existing research on a specific research question or topic. Unlike traditional reviews, which provide a flexible narrative overview, SLRs emphasize rigor, reproducibility, and the minimization of bias by adhering to predefined protocols for search strategies and data synthesis (Rosch et al., 2023). According to Cherry et al. (2023), an SLR systematically identifies, evaluates, and synthesizes research studies using a defined protocol—which includes clear inclusion and exclusion criteria, a thorough literature search, and systematic data extraction. This structured process ensures that the review is transparent and reproducible, offering reliable conclusions that guide future research.\nThese methods minimize bias by following predefined protocols for search strategies and data synthesis, ensuring that the process is rigorous and reliable (Rosch et al., 2023). This structured approach embodies Christian values of diligence and integrity, reflecting the importance of producing trustworthy research that serves others responsibly. As Proverbs 25:2 states, “It is the glory of God to conceal things, but the glory of kings is to search things out,” highlighting the biblical principle of thoroughness and stewardship in the pursuit of knowledge.\nThis emphasis on diligence and intentionality finds a parallel in Indigenous perspectives on knowledge. From an Indigenous worldview, the careful and systematic nature of SLRs aligns with the respect and intentionality required in honoring and preserving knowledge. Both approaches value the ethical responsibility to ensure that information is situated within its proper relational and cultural contexts. By synthesizing information thoughtfully and respectfully, SLRs embody both the precision of systematic inquiry and the relational ethics foundational to Indigenous ways of knowing (Menzies, 2001).\nWhile both traditional literature reviews and SLRs aim to synthesize existing research, their methodologies and purposes differ significantly. Traditional reviews offer a narrative and often subjective overview of research, providing flexibility in summarizing and critiquing studies without strict adherence to predefined protocols. This approach allows for creative integration of diverse perspectives but may introduce bias and limit reproducibility. In contrast, SLRs employ a rigorous, structured methodology to minimize bias, ensure transparency, and enhance reproducibility. By following predefined protocols, including clear inclusion and exclusion criteria, systematic data extraction, and comprehensive search strategies, SLRs provide reliable and objective insights that guide future research. These distinctions highlight the flexibility of traditional reviews for exploratory work and the precision of SLRs for generating trustworthy and reproducible findings. Both approaches play essential roles in advancing scholarship when used appropriately within their respective contexts.\nTable 2.2 captures the key differences and similarities between literature reviews and systematic literature reviews.

    "text": "2.5 Scoping Review\nA scoping review is a preliminary assessment of the available literature on a broad topic (Cherry et al., 2023). A scoping review, sometimes called a scoping search, should be the first search you conduct, using simple search terms to identify general literature relevant to your topic.\nMore specifically, a scoping review is a distinct type of evidence synthesis methodology that systematically identifies, evaluates, and maps the breadth of knowledge on a specific topic or field. Unlike traditional literature reviews or systematic literature reviews, scoping reviews are not comprehensive and do not aim to answer a specific research question. Instead, Cherry et al. (2023) state they are “performed to determine whether your topic area is suitable for a review by giving you a snapshot of the volume and type of evidence available” (p. 45). To determine whether a topic is suitable for researcher, scoping reviews systematically identify, evaluate, and map the breadth of knowledge on a specific topic or field. Unlike systematic reviews, which focus on answering narrowly defined research questions, scoping reviews address broader questions to explore and describe the extent and characteristics of existing literature (Sharma & Goyal, 2023).\nIn summary, the goal of a scoping review is to:\n\nUnderstand the extent and type of research available on a topic.\nDetermine the relevance of a topic by evaluating the volume and diversity of existing evidence.\nIdentify trends, gaps, and areas for further study.\n\nScoping reviews must be conducted early in your research, before finalizing your research question. Doing so is useful in identifying underexplored fields, where mapping the range and type of studies can clarify concepts, identify gaps, and guide future research directions.\nTo ensure a transparent and reliable process, the following steps are critical when conducting a scoping review:\n\nIdentify the Research Question The research question is the cornerstone of a scoping review. It should be broad enough to capture the diversity of literature on the topic, yet clearly defined to maintain focus and direction. Using sub-questions can help balance the breadth of inquiry while ensuring the depth of analysis (Sharma & Goyal, 2023).\nIdentify Relevant Studies Develop a comprehensive search strategy that specifies databases, search terms, and other sources—such as organizational websites and key references. This step ensures that the review includes diverse and interdisciplinary perspectives, drawing from published and unpublished literature (Sharma & Goyal, 2023).\nSelect Studies Screen studies based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. This process typically involves reviewing titles, abstracts, and full texts to determine relevance, where necessary. Employing multiple reviewers and using a flow diagram, as recommended by the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, enhances transparency and reproducibility (Sharma & Goyal, 2023).\nChart the Data Extract and organize key information from each study in a systematic format, such as a spreadsheet or database. Categories often include the author, publication year, study location, population, methodology, main findings, and limitations. This structured approach facilitates a clear overview of the evidence (Sharma & Goyal, 2023).\nCollate, Summarize, and Report Results Synthesize findings into a narrative or descriptive summary that highlights the relationships between the evidence and the review objectives. Visual representations, such as tables, charts, or diagrams, can further illustrate the distribution and characteristics of the included studies (Sharma & Goyal, 2023).\nConsult Stakeholders (Optional) Engage with stakeholders, such as experts or practitioners, to refine the research question, validate findings, or provide feedback. This step enhances the relevance and practical application of the review, particularly for interdisciplinary or applied topics (Sharma & Goyal, 2023).\n\nScoping reviews provide a comprehensive and flexible method for understanding the scope and characteristics of available evidence, particularly in areas where research is heterogeneous or evolving. By following these structured steps, researchers ensure their findings are robust, transparent, and useful for informing future studies. Click here for a sample scoping review.\nThis aligns with servant leadership principles by fostering informed decision-making that serves the greater good and prioritizes others’ needs. From a Christian perspective, the diligence and intentionality required in scoping reviews reflect the biblical call to seek truth and apply knowledge in ways that glorify God and benefit the community (Proverbs 3:13-14).\n\n2.5.1 Activity: Scoping vs. Systematic Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📺 Watch the following video “Systematic vs. Scoping Review: What’s the Difference?” by Carrie Prices (2021).\n\n\n\n📖 Read Chapters 5-10 and 12 in Introduction to Research in Leadership (Rosch et al., 2023).\n✏️Respond to the following in your Reflective Journal:\n\nDiscuss the differences between literature reviews, scoping reviews, and systematic literature reviews.\n\nNote: Your Journal is not graded but will help you in your assessment for this unit.",

    "text": "Summary\nIn conclusion, the exploration of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research methodologies demonstrates the diverse approaches researchers can take to address complex questions. Quantitative research, with its emphasis on numerical analysis and structured methods, provides a systematic framework for uncovering patterns, validating theories, and explaining relationships (Leedy & Ormrod, 2010; Rosch et al., 2023). This approach aligns with the Christian value of stewardship, emphasizing diligence and integrity in managing and interpreting data to serve the greater good.\nConversely, qualitative research offers rich insights into human experiences and complex phenomena through methods like interviews and observations. This approach captures the nuances of leadership and group dynamics, resonating with Indigenous perspectives that value relationality, storytelling, and the interconnectedness of knowledge (Menzies, 2001; Rosch et al., 2023). By prioritizing relationships and context, qualitative research fosters deeper understanding and reciprocity, ensuring that inquiry benefits both researchers and communities.\nMixed methods research integrates the strengths of both quantitative and qualitative approaches, offering a holistic view of multifaceted issues. This methodology reflects the Christian principle of seeking wisdom through multiple sources—Proverbs 15:22: “Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers, they succeed.” By combining diverse perspectives, mixed methods research enhances the validity of findings and supports comprehensive decision-making in leadership contexts (Rosch et al., 2023).\nThe unit also highlighted the essential roles of literature reviews, systematic literature reviews, and scoping reviews. Traditional literature reviews provide narrative overviews, while SLRs emphasize rigor and reproducibility through structured protocols that minimize bias and ensure transparency (Cherry et al., 2023; Sharma & Goyal, 2023). Scoping reviews, meanwhile, offer a broad assessment of available evidence, helping researchers refine their focus and identify knowledge gaps. These methodologies—when approached with respect for relationality and intentionality—align with both Indigenous values of honoring knowledge and Christian principles of stewardship and service.\nAs you develop as a consumer of research, understanding these methodologies equips you to critically evaluate scholarly work, apply evidence-based practices, and contribute to informed leadership. By incorporating the principles of servant leadership, relational ethics, and the pursuit of truth, researchers can ensure their work serves the needs of their communities while advancing knowledge in meaningful and impactful ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking Your Learning\n\n\n\nNow that you have completed the learning activities and assignments for this unit, check the list below to ensure you can do the following:\n\nCan you describe the differences between a quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research report?\nHow can scoping reviews help researchers refine their research questions?\nWhat are the main characteristics that differentiate a traditional literature review from a systematic literature review?\nHow does the methodological rigor of systematic literature reviews contribute to research transparency?\nHow can the principles of servant leadership guide researchers in applying the findings of a scoping or systematic review to serve the needs of their communities?\nFrom a Christian or Indigenous perspective, how can respect for relationality and stewardship influence the way researchers approach literature reviews and evidence synthesis?\n\nReview the unit topics more in depth as needed or continue to the next unit.",

    "section": "3.1 Establishing Purpose in Leadership Research",
    "text": "3.1 Establishing Purpose in Leadership Research\nIt is important to establish a purpose in leadership research. LDRS 591, LDRS 697, and LDRS 698 are not just about completing an assignment to graduate from the Master of Arts (MA) in Leadership program. Instead, these courses are about developing scholarly inquiry skills to inform and strengthen your personal and professional leadership practices. According to Rosch et al. (2023), the purpose of research in leadership goes beyond answering questions—it aims to inform leadership practices, challenge assumptions, and inspire positive change within organizations and communities.\nLeadership research is also an opportunity to live out the call to steward the gifts and knowledge God has given you. Scripture reminds that “whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men” (The Holy Bible, English Standard Version, 2016, Colossians 3:23). Research, then can be a way to seek wisdom and truth that glorifies God and serves others. Leaders are called to align their efforts with God’s purposes, fostering environments of justice, love, and service within their spheres of influence.\nAs you begin thinking about a research topic that interests you, it is important to be aware of your broad goals as a leader. On a personal level, consider how your research might reflect your calling and contribute to God’s work in the world. Additionally, it is important to align your academic and professional goals to get the most out of your research. Cherry et al. (2023) emphasize that research questions should align with both scholarly interests and practical applications, as this alignment ensures sustained motivation and relevance. For Christian leaders, this alignment extends to spiritual principles, ensuring that your research honors God, benefits others, and supports the pursuit of truth.\n\n3.1.1 Activity: Defining Your Research Purpose:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📺 Watch “How to Use Your Interests to Inform Your Literature Review” by Leigh A Hall (2019) about asking significant questions.\n\n\n\nTry using the following three statements to help you get clarity about what exactly you want to investigate.\nIf you can fill out these statements, then you likely have a narrow enough topic with enough direction to perform some great research.\n\nI am researching ____________ (What: Topic),\nbecause I want to find out ________ (So What: Issue/Question),\nin order to ________ (Now What: Application/Purpose).\n\n📖 Read Chapter 2 in Introduction to Research in Leadership (Rosch et al., 2023), “Beginning the Process of Research in Leadership.” Pay close attention to the “Tips for Finding Your Research Purpose” on page 34.\n\n✏️ Reflect. Then respond to the following questions in your Reflective Journal about how your research topic aligns with your broad goals as a leader: How can my research reflect my faith/religious beliefs and contribute to advancing God’s purposes in leadership?\n\nConsider how your work could serve others, glorify God, and promote values like integrity, humility, and love in leadership practices.\n\nWhat are the key values or principles I strive to uphold as a leader, and how might they shape my research interests?\n\nReflecting on your values can guide you toward topics that resonate with your personal leadership philosophy, such as ethical decision-making or fostering inclusive environments.\n\nWhat challenges or opportunities have I encountered in leadership that I feel passionate about addressing or exploring further?\n\nPersonal experiences often reveal areas where more research or understanding is needed, potentially inspiring questions related to overcoming obstacles, supporting team dynamics, or adapting to organizational change.\n\nHow do I envision my research impacting others, both within my organization and in the larger leadership field?\n\nHow can my research honor the voices and experiences of marginalized or underrepresented communities, including Indigenous peoples?\nConsidering the potential impact can help you focus on issues with meaningful applications, whether they are directly practical (e.g., improving team performance) or more theoretical (e.g., understanding leadership behaviours).\n\nWhich leadership skills or qualities do I wish to develop further, and how might a research project support this growth?\n\nIdentifying areas for self-development, such as enhancing emotional intelligence or strengthening adaptive skills, can steer you toward topics that foster both professional and personal growth.\n\nWhat are the broader social, cultural, or organizational trends in leadership that intrigue me, and how might I contribute to these conversations?\n\nIdentifying emerging trends, like diversity and inclusion or technological impacts on leadership, helps ensure your research is relevant to ongoing developments in the field.\n\n\nThese questions encourage reflection on how a research topic can serve your goals as a leader and contribute valuable insights to the broader leadership field.\nBased on your reflection, consider the following steps to define your research purpose:\n\nConnect with Current Issues: Cherry et al. (2023) recommend examining pressing issues within the field, such as equity in leadership or adaptive leadership in crisis situations.\nReflect on Personal and Professional Goals: Identify what motivates you in this research area—are you driven by a desire to promote ethical practices, develop inclusive cultures, or enhance organizational performance?\nSeek Feedback: Discuss your ideas with peers, mentors, or practitioners to see if your topic resonates or to get suggestions for refining your purpose.\nWrite Your Purpose: The purpose of my research is to ….",

    "section": "3.2 Connecting Your Leadership Goals and Purpose to Servant Leadership",
    "text": "3.2 Connecting Your Leadership Goals and Purpose to Servant Leadership\nThe Master of Arts in Leadership program values the application of best practices to your personal and professional practice. MA Lead is founded in Greenleaf’s (1977) servant leadership which has ten characteristics:\n\nListening\nEmpathy\nHealing\nAwareness\nPersuasion\nConceptualization\nForesight\nStewardship\nCommitment to the growth of people\nBuilding community\n\nGreenleaf’s (1977) servant leadership characteristics provide a foundational framework that supports skills and attributes necessary for effective leadership. The above characteristics were addressed throughout your course work, while developing your understanding of servant leadership.\nFor example, in Strategic Leadership, servant leadership emphasizes foresight and conceptualization, which are essential for effective strategic planning. Leaders who adopt this model prioritize long-term goals that benefit all stakeholders, not just the organization. This inclusive approach encourages decision-making that reflects both ethical considerations and community well-being.\nIn Team Leadership and Conflict Resolution, servant leadership’s focus on empathy, healing, and commitment to personal growth is vital. Servant leaders actively listen to their team members, promoting an environment of empathy that supports constructive conflict resolution. This approach builds stronger, more cohesive teams, where members feel understood and valued.\nIn Leadership Values and Ethics, servant leadership can serve as a model that places integrity, stewardship, and the greater good at the forefront of leadership decisions. It promotes a culture of ethical responsibility by prioritizing service over self-interest, ensuring leaders make decisions that positively impact all stakeholders.\nOne more example seen in the course is results-based leadership, which emphasizes measuring what matters. Servant leadership aligns well with this approach by valuing accountability and stewardship. Through a results-oriented lens, servant leadership drives goals that align with organizational values, measuring success not just by financial outcomes but also by positive impacts within the organization and on the community.\nBy integrating servant leadership across these subjects, leaders are encouraged to view their role as one of service, prioritizing ethical considerations, community impact, and individual personal growth. This approach ultimately aligns leadership practices with a deep commitment to serving others and advancing the common good.\nIn summary, the characteristics of servant leadership are at the core of MA Lead and enrich the understanding of what it means to lead effectively in a complex and dynamic environment.\nThinking about your personal, academic, and professional goals, which servant leadership characteristics are most relevant to your topic?\nTry using the following three statements to help you get clarity about what you want to investigate.\nIf you can fill out these statements, then you likely have a narrow enough topic with enough direction to perform some great research.\n\nI am researching ____________________________________ (What: Topic),\nbecause I want to find out _________________________ (So What: Issue/question),\nin order to ________________________________ (Now What: Application/Purpose).",

    "section": "3.3 Developing a Research Question",
    "text": "3.3 Developing a Research Question\nNow that you have identified your research purpose and goals and connected them to servant leadership characteristics, you will have a research topic of interest. It is important to note that a topic of interest is a broad research idea, but you must still develop a clearly focused research question that you are interested in exploring.\nDeveloping a research question is a critical step in the research process since it serves as a bridge between the broader purpose of the study and the specific inquiry that guides data collection and analysis. According to Rosch et al. (2023), researchers usually have a central research question that guides their work and is inherently more concrete than the overarching purpose they aim to address. While the purpose articulates the research’s general goals and intentions, a well-crafted research question provides clarity on the specific aspects of the topic that will be explored. A research question not only guides the research design but also help readers understand the investigation’s scope and the methods that will be employed to gather and analyze data.\nCrafting effective research questions can be one of the most challenging aspects of conducting a research study (Rosch et al., 2023). It requires a deep understanding of the topic, critical thinking, and the ability to articulate specific inquiries that can be systematically investigated. Rosch et al. (2023) highlight that this process is iterative; researchers often refine their questions multiple times as they engage with the literature, gather preliminary data, or reflect on their evolving understanding of the topic. This iterative nature allows researchers to adjust their focus based on insights gained during the initial stages of their inquiry, leading to more robust and meaningful research outcomes. By approaching research question development as a dynamic and flexible process, researchers can enhance the relevance and impact of their studies, paving the way for insightful conclusions and contributions to their field.\nAs you begin drafting your research question, be sure it is:\n\nClear: The question should be specific and straightforward.\nRelevant: Ensure that the question addresses a significant aspect of leadership.\nResearchable: The question should be feasible to investigate given the time and resource constraints.\n\n\nDeveloping Your Questions\n\nStart with “What,” “How,” or “Why:” These words foster exploratory questions that allow for deeper understanding.\nAlign with Your Purpose: Cherry et al. (2023) highlight that research questions should flow naturally from the study’s purpose.\n\n\n\nExample Questions\n\nWhy does empathy enhance team collaboration in Canadian emergency rooms?\nWhat impact do K-12 leaders’ commitment to the growth of people have on employee engagement?\nHow does a business leaders’ foresight impact strategic planning in organizations facing change or crisis?\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Activity: Activity: Crafting a Draft Research Question\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRespond to the following in your Reflective Journal:\n\nReflect on Your Purpose\n\nBegin by revisiting your research’s overarching purpose. Write a brief statement using two to three (2-3) sentences that encapsulates what you aim to achieve with your study. Consider aspects such as personal interests, professional goals, or gaps in existing literature related to leadership.\nExample:\n\n“The purpose of my research is to explore how people development can enhance employee engagement in remote work environments.”\n\n\nBrainstorm Key Themes\n\nBased on your purpose statement, brainstorm three to five (3-5) key themes or areas of interest. These themes will serve as the foundation for your research question.\n\nDraft Potential Research Questions\n\nUsing your themes, formulate two to three (2-3) draft research questions. Make sure to start each question with “What,” “How,” or “Why.” As you draft, keep the following criteria in mind: clarity, relevance, and feasibility of research.\n\nEvaluate Your Questions\n\nAssess each of your draft questions against the following criteria:\n\nClear: Is the question specific and easy to understand?\nRelevant: Does it address a significant aspect of leadership?\nResearchable: Is it feasible to investigate given your time and resource constraints?\n\nRevise any questions that do not meet these criteria.",

In this topic, you will also gain first-hand experience in locating, organizing, and evaluating relevant scholarly literature.\nAccessing scholarly literature can often be a frustrating process for a couple reasons. First, much of it is published in academic journals or databases that may require subscriptions or institutional access, which means it is not always freely available online. Even with access through a university library, students may struggle to navigate databases or know which sources are most credible and relevant. Second, it takes time to determine what key search terms to use for your chosen topic. It is critical that you complete the learning activity 4.1.1 to better understand how to locate literature and ease potential frustration.\nOnce you begin locating research it is important to organize your files. For example, as you begin locating research, save your files in folders titled with general topic areas to help keep your findings organized. Additionally, if you are researching the impact of empathy in healthcare, you might save resources in folders titled “empathy,” “healthcare staff,” and “patients.” As you deepen the breadth of your research, you may add additional folders or subfolders with more specific keywords.\n\nIndigenous Knowledge and Literature in Research\nIndigenous knowledge systems offer valuable perspectives on leadership, community building, and relational ways of knowing. Accessing literature from an Indigenous perspective involves recognizing oral histories, community storytelling, and collective wisdom as valid and respected sources of knowledge. These forms of knowledge may not always appear in traditional scholarly journals or academic databases.\nIn many cases, Indigenous research may be classified as grey literature. Grey literature refers to materials produced outside of traditional academic publishing and commercial distribution channels (Cherry et al., 2024). It includes sources such as reports, policy documents, government publications, white papers, working papers, conference presentations, newsletters, and community plans. Grey literature is often created by organizations that work directly with communities, such as Indigenous organizations, non-governmental organizations, and government agencies, to document programs, share findings, and preserve knowledge for practical use or wider distribution. Because it is not subject to the lengthy processes of academic publishing, grey literature is often more current and directly connected to community priorities and emerging issues.\nWhen conducting research from an Indigenous perspective, it is important to include these types of sources. Consider exploring materials authored by Indigenous scholars, Elders, or organizations, and reflect on how traditional knowledge and community-based wisdom align with your research goals.\n\n\nGenres of Scholarly Literature\nPart of your planning and organizing is to recognize various genres of scholarly literature and to be aware of the limitations inherent in each. There are three distinct categories of documents where you can find research reports: books, journal articles, and grey literature as described above (Cherry et al., 2024).\nYou will often see this sequence followed: A research project is completed, and the research is first published in a Master’s thesis, PhD dissertation, or as a paper in a symposium or conference.\nThe research report is then submitted to a professional journal for publication and eventually it is incorporated into a book. By the time a dissertation is successfully defended, the actual research may have been conducted two to three years prior. It could easily take another three years for a journal article to make it through the peer-review process and be published. Therefore, the research referenced in the final published journal article could be at least five years old. It could easily take another five years for high quality publishers to work through their review processes and publish something in a book, taking away from the currency of the information.\nTable 4.1 below summarizes the relative advantages and disadvantages of each genre of scholarly literature. See Chapter 5 in Doing a Systematic Review: A Student’s Guide (Cherry et al., 2024) for more details about types of evidence available to you:\nTable 3.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of Scholarly Literature Genres\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenre\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nUtility\n\n\n\n\nSummaries (encyclopedias and handbooks)\nGenerally highest quality\nTend to be dated\nEstablish a general working knowledge of the field.\n\n\nBooks\nGenerally high quality\nCan be dated\nEstablish mainstream thought. Most foundational literature is found in books.\n\n\nJournal Articles\nGenerally high quality and provide a clear description of actual research. Generally more current than books or summaries.\nGenerally, will not give a full development of application and implications.\nBest available balance between quality and currency\n\n\nEarly-stage Materials (e.g., conference papers, dissertations, newspapers, personal websites)\nMost current cutting-edge ideas are found in these materials.\nLittle review for quality (except for dissertations) and ideas are not usually well developed\nValuable for establishing trends in current thought. Use cautiously\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is notable to mention that high quality journals are determined by the peer review process, the journal’s Impact Factor (IF), and by professional reputation. Peer review is a process used in academic publishing to ensure the quality and credibility of research. In this process, experts in the same field carefully evaluate a manuscript to assess its originality, accuracy, and significance before it is published. Peer review helps maintain high academic standards and provides authors with constructive feedback to improve their work.\nThe impact factor is a measure of the frequency with which the average article in a journal has been cited in a particular year. The IF is used to measure the importance or rank of a journal by calculating the times its articles are cited. The IF can be found on the home page of most online journals. Knowing where to find this information is important because it allows you to quickly assess the standing of a journal when selecting sources for your research. While impact factor is not the only indicator of quality, it can help you identify widely recognized and frequently cited journals that may contain influential or highly regarded research.\nPeer review is the process used by publishers and editors of academic and scholarly journals to ensure that the articles they publish meet the accepted standards of their respective discipline. Manuscripts under consideration for publication are sent to independent experts in the same field (the author’s scholarly or scientific peers) who evaluate the quality of the scholarship, reliability of findings, relevance to the field, appropriateness for the journal, and other discipline-specific criteria.\nIn summary, understanding how scholarly research is reviewed, published, and ranked is essential for becoming an informed and responsible consumer of research. Tools like peer review and impact factor help you evaluate the credibility, quality, and relevance of academic sources. By using these tools effectively, you can select strong, trustworthy research to support your leadership decisions, academic writing, and future projects.\n\n\n4.1.1 Activity: Research Skills for Lifelong Leadership Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📖 Read Chapters 13 and 14 in Introduction to Research in Leadership (Rosch et al., 2023).

    "text": "4.3 Evaluating Scholarly Literature\nOnce you identify several articles and/or books related to your research topic and skimmed them for relevance, the next step is to evaluate your information sources. Unfortunately, not all information you find will be credible and reliable. Just because you find articles and books at the library does not mean that the information will be accurate or high quality.\nAs an MA Leadership student, and as a professional, it is imperative that you can critically evaluate information you read to conduct quality research yourself, inform policies, and improve your professional practice.\nAs an MA Leadership student and a professional, it is imperative that you critically evaluate the information you read. This skill equips you to conduct high-quality research, inform ethical policy decisions, and improve your professional practice. Making decisions based on reliable research leads to more effective leadership. For example, suppose a study suggests that employees are more engaged when given flexible work hours. A manager might use that insight to redesign team schedules to include flexible start times, aiming to improve morale and productivity.\nHowever, not all research is equally trustworthy. If that study was based on a small group from a single department, while a broader study involving several organizations found that structure and routine were more beneficial for engagement, then relying on the smaller study could lead to poor outcomes. This is why the ability to assess the reliability, context, and methodology of research is essential; it ensures you are making informed, ethical, and effective leadership decisions grounded in credible evidence.\nThis critical lens not only helps leaders evaluate the quality of individual studies, but also encourages them to consider the broader implications of how knowledge is produced and applied. Rosch et al. (2023) define a “critical scholar” as someone who approaches research with a reflective, questioning mindset. Critical scholars challenge conventional wisdom, dominant power structures, and widely accepted norms within their field, often focusing on issues related to justice, equity, and the broader societal impacts of research. They do not take data or theories at face value but analyze how they are constructed, who benefits from them, and who might be marginalized by them.\nA critical scholar applies a high level of intellectual rigor to their work by asking deep questions and interrogating the assumptions, power dynamics, and social structures underpinning research. Rigor in this context refers to the critical scholar’s commitment to challenging the status quo and conducting research that holds up to scrutiny, methodologically and ethically. A critical scholar applies a high level of intellectual rigor to their work by asking deep questions and interrogating the assumptions, power dynamics, and social structures underpinning research. Rigor, in this context, means more than following proper methodology. It involves evaluating who is represented in a study and how its conclusions may impact different groups.\nFor example, imagine a leadership study that claims collaborative leadership styles are the most effective in all workplace settings. Upon closer inspection, the study was conducted only in creative industries like marketing and design. A critical scholar would question whether these findings apply equally to sectors with different operational cultures, such as healthcare or manufacturing. They would dig deeper, considering how context, participant demographics, and underlying assumptions influence the findings. This level of inquiry ensures that research is not only methodologically sound but also ethically grounded and socially aware.\nThe importance of being a critical scholar lies in ensuring that research does not simply reproduce existing biases or inequalities. Instead, it becomes a tool for promoting social justice and equity. By fostering a more inclusive understanding of leadership and organizational behavior, critical scholars help shape systems that better serve diverse populations and future generations.\nTo critically evaluate a source for quality and credibility, consider the following:\n\nAuthority: Who is the author? What are the author’s credentials, such as their educational background, past writing experience, and expertise on the topic? Is the author’s name cited in other sources or reference lists? A simple google search will help you explore these questions.\nCurrency: When was the source published? Is the source current or out of date for your topic? Remember the general rule is to use sources that have been published within the past ten years.\nPurpose: What is the author’s intention? Is the information the author’s opinion or is the author communicating evidence-based results? Who is the author’s intended audience: the academic community or consumers? Is the author’s point of view objective and impartial? Is the article or book’s language free of emotion or bias?\nContent: What kind of information is provided in the article or book? Is it a research article, popular book, or an opinion piece on a blog? If it is a research article, what methodology is used (quantitative, qualitative, etc.). Is the information provided backed up with references or sources? What is the length and quality of the reference list?\nPublication type and process: Who published the source? Was the source peer-reviewed? Is the publisher a university press or a large reputable publisher? Is the source published from a government agency? Is the source self-published?\nBias and special interests: According to Cherry et al. (2023), bias occurs in many forms, including language bias and publication bias. For example, “language bias occurs because studies that report positive findings are mostly likely to be published in English-language journals” (Cherry et al., 2023, p. 53) and studies reporting negative or null findings are most likely to be published in non-English language journals. Publication bias occurs when studies reporting positive findings are more likely published in peer-reviewed academic journals. See Chapter 3 in Doing a Systematic Review: A Student’s Guide (Cherry et al., 2023) for more detail.\n\n\n4.3.1 Activity: Evaluating Sources for Credibility and Quality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📺 Watch “How to Evaluate Sources” from the Stanford University Libraries (2017) to learn more about how to evaluate your sources.\n\n\n\n📖 Read Chapter 8: “Quality Assessment: Where Do I Begin?” in Doing a Systematic Review: A Student’s Guide (Cherry et al., 2023).\n📺 Watch the following videos:\n\n“Assessing Online Resources” from the TWU Library\n“Evaluating a Journal Article” from the JCU Library (2017)\n\n\n\n\n✏️ Respond to the following in your Reflective Journal:\n\nBriefly describe how you found your online sources and whether you think they will be helpful resources for your topic.\nWhat sources of information will you use the most to conduct research on your topic?\nHow will you evaluate these sources to make sure they are credible and reliable sources of information?\n\nNote: Your Journal is not graded but will help you in your assessment for this unit.",

    "text": "5.1 Scoping Review and Refining Research Questions\nRemember from Unit 2, that a scoping review is a preliminary assessment of the available literature on a broad topic (Cherry et al., 2023). Scoping reviews serve to map existing literature and highlight gaps, which can directly inform the specificity and relevance of a research question (Cherry et al., 2023). Conducting a scoping review is an effective strategy to refine and narrow a research question, especially in the initial research stages. From a Christian perspective, this process reflects the values wisdom and stewardship. In the Bible, Proverbs 4:5 states, “Get wisdom, get understanding,” and 1 Peter 4:1-11 says, “Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace.” By thoroughly examining existing knowledge, researchers exercise wisdom in focusing their efforts where they can best serve others and address real-world challenges.\nA scoping review’s primary purpose is to provide an exploratory overview of a broad research area, often addressing emerging or complex topics with diverse data (Gupta et al., 2023; Pham et al., 2014). Scoping reviews clarify the volume, nature, and range of research on a topic (Pham et al., 2014). Further, scoping reviews can identify gaps in literature (Cherry et al., 2023).\nA gap in the literature refers to an area where there is limited, outdated, or missing research on a particular topic. It means that despite previous studies, certain questions remain unanswered, specific populations have not been studied, or emerging issues have not yet been explored.\nIdentifying a gap helps researchers justify the need for their study and shows how their work can contribute something new to the field. For example, if most studies on remote work focus on tech companies, a gap might be how remote work affects healthcare workers or teachers. Recognizing such gaps allows you to build your research around addressing those unexplored areas.\nChristian values encourage addressing these gaps with a heart for justice and service, focusing on issues that uplift marginalized communities or improve human flourishing (Micah 6:8; Zachariah 7:9). Similarly, from the perspective of Canada’s First Peoples, Indigenous frameworks advocate for research that empowers communities and restores balance. In context of Canada’s history, this means addressing areas of colonization and inequity (Ormiston, 2010).\nFor example, let’s say your topic is about the integration of social emotional learning in K-12 schools, and your research question is: How are SEL frameworks implemented across diverse socioeconomic K-12 school contexts? You would then conduct a scoping review to map existing studies on the integration of social-emotional learning (SEL) frameworks in K-12 schools, highlight gaps in research on effective implementation strategies across diverse socioeconomic contexts, and identify the need for longitudinal studies to evaluate the impact of SEL on academic outcomes and student well-being. From a Christian lens, this review could consider how SEL frameworks foster virtues such as compassion, humility, and resilience, aligning with a biblical vision of holistic development (Colossians 3:12). Through an Indigenous lens, the review could explore how SEL frameworks honor relationality, community values, and the inclusion of culturally responsive approaches that respect Indigenous ways of knowing and being (Ormiston, 2010).\nAdditionally, scoping review methodology, initially proposed by Arksey and O’Malley (2007) and later refined by Levac et al. (2010), includes defining research questions, identifying research studies, and summarizing findings. This process can be seen as a prayerful and intentional discernment of priorities, aligning with the biblical call to seek wisdom and understanding (Proverbs 2:3-5). Integrating Indigenous principles, researchers are reminded to engage respectfully with knowledge systems, ensuring that their methods honor the voices and traditions of the communities represented (Ormiston, 2010).\nAt this stage in the process, you have designed an initial research question, identified relevant studies related to your question, and conducted a scoping review to summarize the findings. Now it is time to revise and narrow your research question based on the findings of your scoping review. This step is crucial because it ensures that your research question aligns with the current state of knowledge, addresses identified gaps and remains feasible within the available evidence and resources.\nA Christian perspective calls for humility and purpose in this refinement, recognizing the opportunity to glorify God through meaningful contributions to the field (Colossians 3:23). Similarly, wisdom, one of seven Indigenous sacred teachings, is using one’s gifts to build peaceful and healthy communities (Northwestern Polytechnic, n.d.). A well-refined question not only sharpens your study’s focus but also enhances its relevance and potential to contribute meaningful insights to the field and your community.",

    "text": "5.2 Steps to Refining Your Research Question Based on your Scoping Review\nStep 1: Clarify Key Concepts (Terminology and Definitions)\nA scoping review is instrumental in clarifying key concepts by helping researchers navigate the terms and definitions prevalent in a field. This is achieved by systematically examining existing literature to identify how terms are used and understood within various contexts. By doing so, researchers can align their research question with the established discourse, ensuring consistency and relevance (Gupta et al., 2023).\nFor example, if a scoping review reveals varying definitions for a term like “student engagement” in K-12 education, ranging from behavioral participation to emotional connection, the researcher can adopt or refine a definition that best suits their study. This alignment sharpens the focus of the research and improves communication with the academic community and stakeholders by using language that resonates with existing frameworks.\nIn some cases, researchers may find that different terms are used interchangeably to describe the same concept. For instance, terms like “student involvement” or “classroom participation” might be used in the literature to refer to aspects of “student engagement.” Recognizing and consolidating these terms under a consistent definition enhances clarity and avoids redundancy.\nAdditionally, as researchers conduct a scoping review, they may encounter terms specific to their narrow area of focus that are new to them. For example, within studies of emotional engagement, a term like “affective attunement” might appear in the context of describing the emotional resonance between students and their learning experiences. Learning these nuanced terms allows researchers to refine their understanding of the research topic and frame their study in a way that is precise and informed by the latest developments in the field.\nBy clarifying key concepts and integrating relevant terminology, researchers set a solid foundation for their study and avoid ambiguity that could hinder the interpretation of findings. This process ensures that their work contributes meaningfully to the academic discourse and is accessible to stakeholders within the field.\n\n5.2.1 Activity: Clarifying Key Concepts in Your Scoping Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter reviewing your scoping review, respond to the following questions in your Reflective Journal to help you clarify key concepts:\n\nWhat are the most used terms in the literature related to your research topic, and how are they defined by different authors?\nAre there variations in the usage or interpretation of key terms across different studies or contexts? If so, what might explain these variations?\nDo the definitions of key concepts align with your intended research focus, or do you need to adopt a specific definition or framework?\nSelect 2-3 important terms from the articles you have read that relate to your research topic. For each term, choose a definition from the literature, being sure to cite that definition. (You will include this in your upcoming assignment.)\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Highlighting Gaps\nA key outcome of a scoping review is its ability to identify gaps in existing literature, which provides a foundation for shaping meaningful and impactful research questions. By systematically mapping the current body of knowledge, scoping reviews reveal areas that are under-researched, inconsistently studied, or where evidence is outdated or conflicting (Pham et al., 2014). This process allows researchers to pinpoint voids in knowledge that require further investigation.\nFor example, a scoping review on digital literacy in K-12 education might reveal an abundance of studies focused on middle and high school students but limited research on elementary-level digital literacy instruction. Recognizing this gap enables the researcher to develop a question specifically addressing digital literacy interventions for younger students. Similarly, gaps in methodology, such as a lack of longitudinal studies or insufficient diversity in sampled populations, can inform the design and scope of future research.\nBy highlighting these gaps, scoping reviews ensure that new research contributes to advancing the field rather than duplicating existing work, while also addressing practical or theoretical needs that have not yet been explored.\n\n\n5.2.2 Activity: Highlighting Gaps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter conducting your scoping review, respond to following questions in your Reflective Journal to help you systematically examine your findings to uncover gaps and focus your research efforts on areas with the most potential for contribution in your field:\n\nWhich areas related to my research topic have few or no studies addressing them?\nAre there specific populations, settings, or contexts that are under-represented in existing literature?\nAre there inconsistencies or contradictions in the findings across studies that indicate areas requiring further investigation?\nWhat trends or emerging themes in the literature suggest areas where research has not yet kept pace with practical or theoretical developments?\nWhat insights from the literature stand out?",

    "text": "5.3 Step 3: Assessing Feasibility\nAssessing the feasibility of a research question involves evaluating whether the question can be practically addressed given the available resources, literature, data, and time constraints for a systematic review. A scoping review is instrumental in this process, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the existing evidence and identifies areas with sufficient data to support research efforts (Pham et al., 2014).\nBy understanding the scope and availability of data, researchers can determine whether their question is too broad, too narrow, or misaligned with existing literature. For example, if the scoping review reveals a lack of empirical studies on a specific intervention, researchers might refine their question to focus on related interventions with more robust evidence. Alternatively, if the review uncovers abundant but heterogeneous data, the research question can be tailored to focus on a specific subset of studies or outcomes that are most relevant.\nThis process ensures that research questions are both actionable and meaningful. Aligning the question with available evidence allows researchers to design studies that are achievable within the scope of their resources, while also contributing valuable insights to the field. Assessing feasibility minimizes wasted effort and increases the likelihood of producing impactful research.\n\n5.3.1 Activity: Assessing Feasibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRespond to following questions in your Reflective Journal to help you assess the feasibility of your research question:\n\nDoes the existing literature provide sufficient data to address my research question, or are there significant gaps that may hinder my ability to investigate it?\nIs my research question specific enough to be addressed within the available time, resources, and scope of my study?\nDoes my research question target a manageable scope of literature, avoiding being too broad or too narrow for a systematic review?\n\nNote: Your Journal is not graded but will help you in your assessment for this unit.\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Activity: Learning Activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch “How to Write a Research Question for Your Literature Review” (Hall, 2019):\n\n\n\nReview the following sample general Research Questions (RQ) and corresponding revised specific Research Questions. Seeing how they differ will help you learn why a clear, focused research question is essential for a successful systematic review. 1. General Question: What factors influence patient satisfaction in healthcare settings? Revised Specific RQ: How do communication strategies used by primary care physicians impact patient satisfaction in urban outpatient clinics?\n2.  **General Question**: What are the effects of technology on student learning? **Revised Specific RQ**: How does the use of gamified learning platforms affect math achievement among middle school students in rural schools?\n\n3.  **General Question**: What drives employee engagement in organizations? **Revised Specific RQ**: What is the impact of flexible work policies on employee engagement in technology startups with under 500 employees?\nUse the checklist below to critique and revise your initial draft research question:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nIdentify Specific Aspects of Interest\nFrom your review, highlight specific elements that intrigue you. For example, if your broad topic is “leadership in education,” narrow it to aspects such as “the influence of transformational leadership on student engagement.”\n\n\nClarify Key Concepts\nIdentify and define the most important concepts and terms in your scoping review. Provide definitions based on how these terms are used in the literature. Cite your sources to show how different authors define or apply these terms and note any variations in usage that may influence your understanding of the topic.\n\n\nIdentify Gaps\nWhat areas of your topic are under-researched, inconsistently studied, or where evidence is outdated or conflicting.\n\n\nUtilize the “Five Ws” Technique\nAnswer the following questions to refine your focus:\n\nWho: Who are the subjects/participants of your research? (e.g., educators, students)\nWhat: What specific behaviors or phenomena are you studying? (e.g., building community, engagement strategies, digital literacy)\nWhere: In what context will your research occur? (e.g., high schools, online learning environments)\nWhen: Are you focusing on a specific timeframe? (e.g., during the transition to remote learning)\nWhy: Why is this question significant in leadership studies?\n\n\n\nCheck for Clarity and Specificity\nEnsure your refined question is clear, specific, and straightforward. Avoid vague language, and make sure the research question is easily understandable.\n\n\nEvaluate Relevance\nConfirm that your revised research question addresses a significant, specific, aspect of leadership and aligns with your research purpose. Ensure your research has the potential to contribute meaningfully to the field.\n\n\nAssess Feasibility of Research\nEnsure your research question is feasible to investigate within your given time and resource constraints. Consider data and literature availability.\n\n\nIterate and Seek Feedback\nShare your refined question with peers, mentors, or faculty. Gather constructive feedback to further clarify and strengthen your inquiry.",

As a leader, your role is not only to consume knowledge, but to apply it wisely and judiciously. These two adverbs, wisely and judiciously, should not be overlooked. In leadership practice, decisions grounded in credible research must be made with discernment, humility, and integrity.\nPlano Clark and Creswell (2014) remind us that we read research “to learn new knowledge about topics, to become informed on policy debates, and to find suggestions for improving your practice” (p. 15). Throughout this course, you have learned how to engage with research in ways that reflect these goals.\nNow, as you conclude LDRS 591, you will synthesize what you have learned and apply it to your own scholarly journey. You have explored different types of research, developed a research question, accessed and evaluated scholarly literature, and conducted a scoping review to refine and narrow your topic. In this final unit, you will draw these elements together by writing a Letter of Intent. This letter will outline your proposed research direction and demonstrate your readiness to transition into either the Capstone (Systematic Literature Review) or Thesis track in the MA in Leadership program.",

    "text": "6.1 Understanding the Ethical Responsibilities of Leadership Research\nLeadership research is not conducted in a vacuum; it occurs within real communities, organizations, and systems, and it often influences policies, practices, and people. For this reason, ethical responsibility is central to scholarly inquiry in leadership studies. Researchers are not only accountable for methodological rigor but also for the social, cultural, and relational impacts of their work.\nEthical leadership research requires careful consideration of how knowledge is gathered, interpreted, and applied. This includes respecting the dignity, rights, and perspectives of participants and communities, ensuring informed consent, maintaining confidentiality, and minimizing harm. In particular, researchers must be vigilant about how power dynamics, personal biases, and organizational interests may influence the research process and outcomes (Israel & Hay, 2006).\nFrom a Christian worldview, ethical research reflects stewardship, humility, and justice. Proverbs 2:9–10 speaks of the value of wisdom in guiding just and fair actions: “Then you will understand what is right and just and fair; every good path. For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul”. As servant leaders, scholars are called to use research as a means of service by seeking truth, advancing equity, and contributing to the flourishing of others (Greenleaf, 1977).\nIndigenous perspectives also enrich our understanding of research ethics. Indigenous scholars emphasize relational accountability, meaning that researchers are responsible not only for what they learn but also for how they relate to the people and knowledge systems involved (Wilson, 2008). Knowledge is not seen as a commodity to be extracted but as something to be shared with respect, reciprocity, and permission.\nIn the context of the MA in Leadership, understanding these ethical responsibilities will guide your decisions as you design your research question, choose your sources, and determine how to represent and apply knowledge. Whether you pursue a capstone or thesis track, your research should demonstrate integrity, cultural awareness, and a commitment to the common good.",

    "text": "7.1 The Purpose of APA 7\nIn professional and academic writing, APA 7 formatting serves as a critical guide for consistency, clarity, and credibility. Established by the American Psychological Association (APA), APA format is widely used in fields such as psychology, education, and social sciences. But why is it important, and how does it relate to professionalism and leadership?\n\nWhy APA 7 Matters for Professionalism\nUsing APA style is not just about following rules; it demonstrates a commitment to precision and attention to detail. A well-structured, accurately formatted document reflects professionalism and respect for the work of others, as it prioritizes clear communication and proper citation of sources. By adhering to APA guidelines, writers convey their information clearly, minimize ambiguity, and ensure their audience can easily follow and verify their sources. This fosters trust and credibility, qualities that are essential for servant leadership and a professional reputation.\n\n\nWhy APA 7 Matters for Leadership\nEffective leadership requires solid ideas and the ability to communicate those ideas effectively and responsibly. APA formatting supports leadership by providing a standardized way to present research, insights, and recommendations that others can easily understand. Leaders who use APA demonstrate ethical responsibility by giving proper credit to the work of others, thereby modeling respect for intellectual property and encouraging a culture of accountability. In this way, using APA 7 aligns with servant leadership principles by placing the needs of others first, and fostering a climate of trust and ethical behavior (Coetzer et al., 2017; McMahone, 2012). Furthermore, mastering APA style highlights a leader’s commitment to fostering accountability and a climate of ethical behavior.\nAdditionally, as servant leaders strive toward ethical practices, APA is a tool for exhibiting accountability by attributing ideas responsibly. This culture of accountability extends beyond APA adherence, setting a standard that encourages ethical, respectful communication and stewardship of knowledge. By promoting accurate citations, servant leaders cultivate an environment that respects the intellectual contributions of all, enhancing organizational integrity and ethical behavior (Coetzer et al., 2017; McMahone, 2012).\nThroughout LDRS 591, your instructor will guide you in exploring key elements of APA 7 formatting to elevate your writing and support you in developing professional, clear, and ethically responsible written communications that create a culture of trust and accountability.",

    "text": "7.4 Citations\nImagine you have spent weeks working on a project at work; A presentation with detailed research and new ideas that you are excited to share with your team. Now, picture someone taking your presentation, removing your name, and presenting it as their own work without mentioning you. How would you feel?\nJust as people expect acknowledgment for their own ideas and hard work, using citations in academic or professional writing gives credit to the original authors who inspired or informed our work. Citing sources shows respect for others’ contributions, demonstrating that you value their ideas enough to share them with others. This is not just about avoiding plagiarism; it is about building a culture of respect, trust, and professionalism. Properly formatted citations help ensure that others can verify and follow up on the sources you have used, creating a chain of knowledge that strengthens our shared understanding.\n\nCitations and Stewardship\nCiting sources aligns closely with the concept of stewardship in servant leadership. Peter Block (2013) defines stewardship as “holding something in trust for another,” (p. xx) a principle that underscores people’s responsibility to care for and respect others’ contributions. In servant leadership, stewardship means leaders hold knowledge, resources, and responsibilities in trust—not for personal gain, but for the benefit of the community and society.\nApplying this principle, citing sources in our work becomes an act of stewardship. You are acknowledging and preserving the intellectual contributions of others and using them in a way that respects their origin and purpose. Just as servant leaders use openness and persuasion over control, citations allow people to transparently share ideas, enabling others to trace, verify, and build upon those ideas for the collective good. This practice reflects a commitment to serve the academic and professional communities by fostering a culture of respect, integrity, and shared knowledge.\n\n\nCitations and Indigenous Storytelling\nIn Indigenous storytelling, stewardship and proper acknowledgment are essential aspects of preserving and respecting knowledge. Land acknowledgments are an important practice in recognizing Indigenous stewardship and the original keepers of the land (Hanson, 2009). For example, you may notice the land acknowledgement on the course syllabus:\n\n“We acknowledge that Trinity Western University, Langley campus is located on the traditional ancestral unceded territory of the Stó:lō people.”\nThis practice reflects the values of respect and responsibility toward those who have historically cared for and continue to care for the land.\nSimilarly, Indigenous oral traditions are rich with stories passed down through generations, where each storyteller holds a piece of collective memory and knowledge in trust, as noted by Elders and knowledge keepers. This stewardship of knowledge is not just about the storyteller; it is about honoring the voices and wisdom of those who came before (Hanson, 2009).\nJust as citing sources in academic work gives credit to the original thinkers, land acknowledgments recognize Indigenous peoples as the rightful stewards of the land. This practice emphasizes respect and gratitude (Hanson, 2009), connecting to Peter Block’s (2013) idea of stewardship as “holding something in trust for another,” (p. xx) recognizing the historical and ongoing relationship Indigenous Peoples have with the land. Additionally, just as citing a source respects the intellectual property of others, acknowledging original knowledge keepers of an Indigenous story honors those who have preserved this wisdom over generations.\nCitations in Western academia give credit, while in Indigenous traditions, “oral footnoting” attributes the story to a specific elder or ancestor, reflecting the storyteller’s responsibility to the collective memory (Hanson, 2009). This act of stewardship, both in academic and Indigenous contexts, upholds a culture of respect, ensuring that knowledge is shared ethically, responsibly, and for the benefit of future generations.\n\n\n7.4.1 Activity: Citations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice formatting APA 7 in-text citations by solving a puzzle using the correct citation style for paraphrased and direct quotes.

    "text": "7.5 References\nAs Indigenous storytelling practices and academic citations embody stewardship and foster a culture of sharing knowledge responsibly and respectfully, so do references. Like using citations, including references is another way to practice servant leadership in written communication.\nA shift toward servant leadership in organizations today reflects a movement away from traditional, hierarchical structures to one rooted in ethical, compassionate, and inclusive leadership (Spears, 2010). This approach, defined by principles like stewardship, empathy, and commitment to the growth of others (Spears, 2010), aligns deeply with the practice of using APA references in academic and professional writing. APA referencing allows people to ethically credit original thinkers and contributors, building trust and transparency in their work. From a servant leadership perspective, using citations is an act of stewardship; It involves holding knowledge in trust for others, using it responsibly, and ensuring that ideas are shared openly for the benefit of the entire community.\nAPA references also embody key servant leadership traits, such as commitment to the growth of others and building community. By providing accurate references, we not only acknowledge the efforts of others but also empower our readers to explore the original sources, deepening their understanding and engagement with the topic. This aligns with servant leadership’s dedication to individual growth and the creation of a collaborative, knowledge-sharing environment (Spears, 2010). In this way, references help build a community of learning, where ideas circulate ethically and openly.\nFurther, servant leaders rely on awareness and foresight, seeing the broader impacts of their actions on others (Spears, 2010). By referencing sources, writers exercise these qualities, understanding that their work does not stand alone but is part of a larger discourse. This approach supports a responsible, forward-thinking culture where ideas are treated with respect and integrity, creating a positive and ethical academic and professional environment.\n\n7.5.1 Activity: References Formatting Puzzle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice formatting references according to APA 7 guidelines by solving a puzzle that involves properly formatting citations for journals, books, and web sources.
