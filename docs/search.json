    "title": "Overview",
    "section": "Boyer’s Model of Scholarship",
    "text": "Boyer’s Model of Scholarship\nThe MA in Leadership program is focused on applied scholarship. In defining this, Boyer’s four-part Model of Scholarship (1997) is useful. Boyer’s typology identifies four domains of scholarship: discovery, integration, application, and teaching. Marta Nibert (2011) discusses the model in her paper titled “Boyer’s Model of Scholarship.”\nIn the section titled “Application,” Nibert (2011) notes that the scholarship of application:\n\nfocuses on using research findings and innovations to remedy societal problems. Included in this category are service activities that are specifically tied to one’s field of knowledge and professional activities. Beneficiaries of these activities include commercial entities, non-profit organizations, and professional associations (para. 4).\n\nThough Nibert’s primary audience is the professoriate, this material is relevant for MA Leadership learners. Application is highlighted because this program was designed to focus on the scholarship of application, although work in the capstone will likely include one or more of the other domains.\n\nScholarship of Discovery\nBoyer’s Scholarship of Discovery is the type of scholarship associated with traditional scholarly research. “Research is a systematic process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting information (data) in order to increase our understanding of a phenomenon abut which we are interested or concerned” (Leedy & Ormrod, 2010, p. 2). Boyer’s Scholarship of Discovery is often referred to as primary research. Primary research is narrowly focused and contributes to the body of knowledge by helping people understand one isolated part of reality in detail in the hopes that this understanding can be generalized to a broader part of reality. In traditional research, the Scholarship of Discovery falls into two distinct genres: quantitative and qualitative research. Each of these genres manifest in numerous variations, including hybrid models involving both quantitative and qualitative elements, designed for and suited to differing research questions.\n\n\nScholarship of Integration\nBoyer’s Scholarship of Integration is “the attempt to arrange relevant bits of knowledge and insight from different disciplines into broader patterns that reflect the actual interconnectedness of the world” (Boyer, as cited in Jacobsen & Jacobsen, 2004, p. 51).\nThe Scholarship of Integration often involves interdisciplinary collaboration and requires critical analysis and review of knowledge, followed by the creative synthesis of ideas to address specific topics or issues.\n\n\nScholarship of Application\nThe Scholarship of Application is “the scholarship of engagement; seeking to close the gap between values in the academy and the needs of the larger world” (Boyer, as cited in Jacobsen & Jacobsen, 2004, p. 51). In the Scholarship of Application, knowledge is applied to the solution of societal needs and practice. In most cases, knowledge stemming from the Scholarship of Discovery and the Scholarship of Integration informs the solutions to problems. These scholarships are often associated with the context of formal education. Although the Scholarship of Application may happen within formal education contexts, it is most often associated with other settings (Boshier, 2009, p. 6).\n\n\nScholarship of Teaching\nFinally, the Scholarship of Teaching is “the scholarship of sharing knowledge” (Boyer, as cited in Jacobsen & Jacobsen, 2004, p. 51). The Scholarship of Teaching involves the reflective analysis of the knowledge about teaching and learning. This knowledge base itself is the product of the Scholarships of Discovery, Integration and Application combining as “active ingredients of a dynamic and iterative teaching process” (Boshier, 2009, p. 5). Boyer’s typology originally identified as the Scholarship of Teaching has expanded and is now widely known in literature as the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (Boshier, 2009).\nBoshier contends that Boyer’s four domains were conceived holistically as elements that overlap and interact, not as discrete elements, appearing in any predictable order, and are better viewed as an operating system than a list of discrete elements (Boshier, 2009, pp. 4-5). As such, it is helpful to view the model as a Venn diagram where each scholarship domain overlaps (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1\nBoyer’s Model of Scholarship\nNote: This figure demonstrates how the four domains of Boyer’s Model of Scholarship overlap and interact to create a holistic system of scholarship.\nLDRS 591 is designed to help you understand types of research, identify a research topic, develop a research question, and decide whether you will pursue a thesis track in your MA Leadership studies. Should you choose the thesis track, you will engage in Scholarship of Discovery, meaning you will conduct primary research.\nNote: Choosing the thesis track requires approval from the Department of Leadership Program Director.\nMost program students choose the capstone track, in which they conduct secondary research.\n\n\nActivity: Learning Activity\n📺 Watch the following video “Introduction to Research Design” from Research & Doctoral Services at Walden University (2015) where Dr. Patton introduces the concept of research as a scholar-practitioner:\n\n\n\n\n\n✏️ Respond to the following in your Reflective Journal:\n\nDescribe at least one example of a decision you have made as a leader.\nConsider the factors that went into that decision making process (e.g., values, research, policy, past experience, expert opinion).\nWhat do you consider as “evidence” in your decision making?\nIn your own words, why is evidence-based decision-making important in leadership?\n\nNote: your Journal is not graded but will help you in your assessment for this unit.",

In graduate-level leadership studies, being able to engage with research critically is not just an academic exercise, but a vital leadership skill. Leaders must be able to evaluate research-based evidence, apply it thoughtfully in practice, and contribute to informed decision-making in their organizations and communities.\nIn this unit, you will be introduced to several common research methodologies that are frequently used in leadership and social sciences research:\nUnderstanding these research approaches will equip you to read academic studies with greater confidence, recognize the strengths and limitations of different methodologies, and assess the credibility of research findings. This knowledge is also essential for your upcoming assignments, particularly your systematic literature review, which is a major project in LDRS 697 and 698. Through this unit, you will begin building the foundational skills necessary to complete that review, as well as to become a more informed consumer of research throughout your leadership practice.\nUnit 2 is divided into six topics.

    "section": "Qualitative Methodology",
    "text": "Qualitative Methodology\nIn contrast to quantitative research, qualitative research has three distinct purposes: to describe and explain, to explore and interpret, and to build theory (Leedy & Ormrod, 2010). These differing research purposes find expression in differing research processes, the kinds of data gathered, the approaches to data analysis, and finally in the ways findings are communicated.\nCounter to quantitative research, qualitative research is a method of inquiry that focuses on understanding complex phenomena through the collection and analysis of non-numerical data, such as words, images, and experiences. In Chapter 8 of Introduction to Research in Leadership, Rosch et al. (2023) describe qualitative research as an approach that seeks to explore the depth and richness of human experience, particularly in social and organizational contexts.\nBecause qualitative research focuses on human experiences, it resonates strongly with Indigenous approaches to knowledge, which prioritize relationships, context, and interconnectedness. Menzies (2001) emphasized that Indigenous methodologies often involve storytelling, oral traditions, and respect for the lived experiences of participants. Researchers are encouraged to adopt a relational approach, viewing participants as co-creators of knowledge rather than subjects of study. This perspective ensures that research benefits the community and the academic field, embodying principles of reciprocity and respect.\nTo explore human experiences, qualitative research often involves conducting interviews, focus groups, or content analysis, which allow researchers to gather insights into participants’ perspectives, experiences, motivations, and emotions. Qualitative research is particularly valuable in leadership studies, as it captures the nuances of individual and group dynamics that quantitative methods might overlook.\nAdditionally, a key feature of qualitative research is its flexibility; researchers can adapt their methods as new insights emerge during the study. Rosch et al. (2023) note that this adaptability enables a deeper understanding of the context in which leadership occurs. The authors also highlight the importance of reflexivity, encouraging researchers to reflect on their own biases and influences throughout the research process.\nIn summary, qualitative research provides a rich and detailed understanding of human behavior and organizational phenomena, making it an essential tool for exploring the complexities of leadership and decision-making.\nThe differing designs of quantitative and qualitative research lead to marked differences in how data are analyzed. Quantitative data is approached primarily through deductive reasoning, employing statistical analyses applied to numerical data, with stress on objectivity. In contrast, qualitative data is approached primarily through inductive reasoning with the goal being to uncover themes and categories, with acknowledgement of potential researcher bias and subjectivity.

    "text": "Mixed Methods Methodology\nMixed methods research combines quantitative and qualitative approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena. Rosch et al. (2023) describe mixed methods as a strategy that leverages the strengths of both methodologies, allowing researchers to explore questions from multiple perspectives.\nMixed methods research involves collecting and analyzing both numerical data and non-numerical data, which can enrich the findings and offer deeper insights. For example, researchers might use quantitative surveys to identify trends and patterns, followed by qualitative interviews to explore the meanings and experiences behind those trends. This approach enhances the validity and reliability of the research, as it provides a more holistic view of the subject matter (Rosch et al., 2023).\nMixed methods research reflects the biblical principle of seeking wisdom through multiple sources (“Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers, they succeed,” Proverbs 15:22). Combining quantitative and qualitative insights mirrors the Christian commitment to balance and thorough understanding in addressing complex issues.\nRosch et al. (2023) also highlight the importance of integrating the findings from both methods to create a cohesive narrative that informs leadership practices and theories. This reflects the biblical principle of seeking wisdom through multiple sources, as Proverbs 15:22 states, “Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers, they succeed.” Combining quantitative and qualitative insights mirrors the Christian commitment to balance and thorough understanding in addressing complex issues. By employing mixed methods, researchers can address complex questions that cannot be fully understood through a single methodological lens.\nIn summary, mixed methods research is a powerful approach in leadership studies, facilitating a multifaceted exploration of issues and contributing to a richer understanding of organizational dynamics and human behavior.\n\nActivity: Learning Activity\n📺 Watch the following videos:\n\n“Qualitative & Quantitative Research – An Introduction” by Tine Juhl (2017).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“What is Mixed Methods Research?” by Michigan Medicine (2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n✏️ Reflect.

    "text": "Literature Review\nWhether or not you realize it, you may have read literature reviews in your studies to date.\nBy definition, a literature review examines and evaluates published work related to a specific subject. In some cases, it focuses on research from a particular time frame. Rather than simply summarizing sources, a literature review follows a structured approach that blends summary with synthesis. While a summary highlights the key points from each source, synthesis involves reorganizing and integrating that information to present new insights or connections among the studies (Mastrodonato, n.d.).\nRosch et al. (2023) highlight that a traditional literature review is often narrative and subjective, summarizing existing research without adhering to a strict methodology. Traditional reviews may lack comprehensive search strategies and systematic analysis, leading to potential biases in how studies are selected and interpreted.\nAdditionally, Cooper (1988) identified the primary functions of literature reviews as summarising, classifying, and critically evaluating, which help inform researchers about what has been done and what remains to be explored about a particular topic.\nRosch et al. (2023) emphasize that literature reviews play a crucial role in research, particularly in fields like leadership, by offering insights into theoretical frameworks, methodologies, and practical implications. Literature reviews help researchers situate their work within the broader academic discourse and can guide future research directions.\nAdditionally, peer-reviewed studies consistently highlight the importance of literature reviews in establishing a foundation for new research by summarizing existing work, identifying gaps, and guiding future inquiry (Cooper, 1988). Literature reviews play a crucial role in research, particularly in fields like leadership, by offering insights into theoretical frameworks, methodologies, and practical implications (Rosch et al., 2023. This flexibility can lead to biases in how studies are selected and interpreted, particularly when search strategies and analyses are not comprehensive.\nFrom a Christian perspective, engaging with literature reviews reflects the biblical call to stewardship and the pursuit of truth. By thoughtfully analyzing and synthesizing previous research, scholars fulfill their responsibility to use knowledge wisely, align their work with ethical principles, and serve the greater good—Colossians 3:23: “Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men.” The narrative nature of traditional literature reviews aligns with this stewardship by encouraging researchers to thoughtfully engage with existing knowledge while remaining diligent and accountable in their efforts—Proverbs 21:5: “The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance.”\nMoreover, literature reviews can be understood as a form of storytelling, resonating with Indigenous methodologies that value relationality and interconnectedness (Battiste, 2005; Menzies, 2001). For Indigenous scholars, storytelling is an essential practice for weaving together diverse knowledge sources, preserving their integrity, and situating them within a broader relational context. Traditional literature reviews parallel this practice by connecting past knowledge to current and future inquiry, ensuring that the voices and perspectives within the research are acknowledged and respected.",

    "section": "Systematic Literature Review",
    "text": "Systematic Literature Review\nWhile traditional literature reviews provide a flexible narrative overview, more structured approaches, such as systematic literature reviews (SLRs), emphasize rigor and reproducibility.\nA SLR is a comprehensive and structured approach to evaluating existing research on a specific research question or topic. Unlike traditional reviews, which provide a flexible narrative overview, SLRs emphasize rigor, reproducibility, and the minimization of bias by adhering to predefined protocols for search strategies and data synthesis (Rosch et al., 2023). According to Cherry et al. (2024), an SLR systematically identifies, evaluates, and synthesizes research studies using a defined protocol—which includes clear inclusion and exclusion criteria, a thorough literature search, and systematic data extraction. This structured process ensures that the review is transparent and reproducible, offering reliable conclusions that guide future research.\nThese methods minimize bias by following predefined protocols for search strategies and data synthesis, ensuring that the process is rigorous and reliable (Rosch et al., 2023). This structured approach embodies Christian values of diligence and integrity, reflecting the importance of producing trustworthy research that serves others responsibly. As Proverbs 25:2 states, “It is the glory of God to conceal things, but the glory of kings is to search things out,” highlighting the biblical principle of thoroughness and stewardship in the pursuit of knowledge.\nThis emphasis on diligence and intentionality finds a parallel in Indigenous perspectives on knowledge. From an Indigenous worldview, the careful and systematic nature of SLRs aligns with the respect and intentionality required in honoring and preserving knowledge. Both approaches value the ethical responsibility to ensure that information is situated within its proper relational and cultural contexts. By synthesizing information thoughtfully and respectfully, SLRs embody both the precision of systematic inquiry and the relational ethics foundational to Indigenous ways of knowing (Menzies, 2001).\nWhile both traditional literature reviews and SLRs aim to synthesize existing research, their methodologies and purposes differ significantly. Traditional reviews offer a narrative and often subjective overview of research, providing flexibility in summarizing and critiquing studies without strict adherence to predefined protocols. This approach allows for creative integration of diverse perspectives but may introduce bias and limit reproducibility. In contrast, SLRs employ a rigorous, structured methodology to minimize bias, ensure transparency, and enhance reproducibility. By following predefined protocols, including clear inclusion and exclusion criteria, systematic data extraction, and comprehensive search strategies, SLRs provide reliable and objective insights that guide future research. These distinctions highlight the flexibility of traditional reviews for exploratory work and the precision of SLRs for generating trustworthy and reproducible findings. Both approaches play essential roles in advancing scholarship when used appropriately within their respective contexts.\nTable 2.2 captures the key differences and similarities between literature reviews and systematic literature reviews.

    "section": "Scoping Review",
    "text": "Scoping Review\nA scoping review is a preliminary assessment of the available literature on a broad topic (Cherry et al., 2024). A scoping review, sometimes called a scoping search, should be the first search you conduct, using simple search terms to identify general literature relevant to your topic.\nMore specifically, a scoping review is a distinct type of evidence synthesis methodology that systematically identifies, evaluates, and maps the breadth of knowledge on a specific topic or field. Unlike traditional literature reviews or systematic literature reviews, scoping reviews are not comprehensive and do not aim to answer a specific research question. Instead, Cherry et al. (2024) state they are “performed to determine whether your topic area is suitable for a review by giving you a snapshot of the volume and type of evidence available” (p. 45). To determine whether a topic is suitable for researcher, scoping reviews systematically identify, evaluate, and map the breadth of knowledge on a specific topic or field. Unlike systematic reviews, which focus on answering narrowly defined research questions, scoping reviews address broader questions to explore and describe the extent and characteristics of existing literature (Sharma & Goyal, 2023).\nIn summary, the goal of a scoping review is to:\n\nUnderstand the extent and type of research available on a topic.\nDetermine the relevance of a topic by evaluating the volume and diversity of existing evidence.\nIdentify trends, gaps, and areas for further study.\n\nScoping reviews must be conducted early in your research, before finalizing your research question. Doing so is useful in identifying underexplored fields, where mapping the range and type of studies can clarify concepts, identify gaps, and guide future research directions.\nTo ensure a transparent and reliable process, the following steps are critical when conducting a scoping review:\n\nIdentify the Research Question The research question is the cornerstone of a scoping review. It should be broad enough to capture the diversity of literature on the topic, yet clearly defined to maintain focus and direction. Using sub-questions can help balance the breadth of inquiry while ensuring the depth of analysis (Sharma & Goyal, 2023).\nIdentify Relevant Studies Develop a comprehensive search strategy that specifies databases, search terms, and other sources—such as organizational websites and key references. This step ensures that the review includes diverse and interdisciplinary perspectives, drawing from published and unpublished literature (Sharma & Goyal, 2023).\nSelect Studies Screen studies based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. This process typically involves reviewing titles, abstracts, and full texts to determine relevance, where necessary. Employing multiple reviewers and using a flow diagram, as recommended by the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, enhances transparency and reproducibility (Sharma & Goyal, 2023).\nChart the Data Extract and organize key information from each study in a systematic format, such as a spreadsheet or database. Categories often include the author, publication year, study location, population, methodology, main findings, and limitations. This structured approach facilitates a clear overview of the evidence (Sharma & Goyal, 2023).\nCollate, Summarize, and Report Results Synthesize findings into a narrative or descriptive summary that highlights the relationships between the evidence and the review objectives. Visual representations, such as tables, charts, or diagrams, can further illustrate the distribution and characteristics of the included studies (Sharma & Goyal, 2023).\nConsult Stakeholders (Optional) Engage with stakeholders, such as experts or practitioners, to refine the research question, validate findings, or provide feedback. This step enhances the relevance and practical application of the review, particularly for interdisciplinary or applied topics (Sharma & Goyal, 2023).\n\nScoping reviews provide a comprehensive and flexible method for understanding the scope and characteristics of available evidence, particularly in areas where research is heterogeneous or evolving. By following these structured steps, researchers ensure their findings are robust, transparent, and useful for informing future studies. Click here for a sample scoping review.\nThis aligns with servant leadership principles by fostering informed decision-making that serves the greater good and prioritizes others’ needs. From a Christian perspective, the diligence and intentionality required in scoping reviews reflect the biblical call to seek truth and apply knowledge in ways that glorify God and benefit the community (Proverbs 3:13-14).\n\nActivity: Learning Activity\n📺 Watch the following video “Systematic vs. Scoping Review: What’s the Difference?” by Carrie Prices (2021).\n📖 Read Chapters 5-10 and 12 in Introduction to Research in Leadership (Rosch et al., 2023).\n✏️Respond to the following in your Reflective Journal:\n\nDiscuss the differences between literature reviews, scoping reviews, and systematic literature reviews.\n\nNote: Your Journal is not graded but will help you in your assessment for this unit.",

    "text": "Summary\nIn conclusion, the exploration of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research methodologies demonstrates the diverse approaches researchers can take to address complex questions. Quantitative research, with its emphasis on numerical analysis and structured methods, provides a systematic framework for uncovering patterns, validating theories, and explaining relationships (Leedy & Ormrod, 2010; Rosch et al., 2023). This approach aligns with the Christian value of stewardship, emphasizing diligence and integrity in managing and interpreting data to serve the greater good.\nConversely, qualitative research offers rich insights into human experiences and complex phenomena through methods like interviews and observations. This approach captures the nuances of leadership and group dynamics, resonating with Indigenous perspectives that value relationality, storytelling, and the interconnectedness of knowledge (Menzies, 2001; Rosch et al., 2023). By prioritizing relationships and context, qualitative research fosters deeper understanding and reciprocity, ensuring that inquiry benefits both researchers and communities.\nMixed methods research integrates the strengths of both quantitative and qualitative approaches, offering a holistic view of multifaceted issues. This methodology reflects the Christian principle of seeking wisdom through multiple sources—Proverbs 15:22: “Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers, they succeed.” By combining diverse perspectives, mixed methods research enhances the validity of findings and supports comprehensive decision-making in leadership contexts (Rosch et al., 2023).\nThe unit also highlighted the essential roles of literature reviews, systematic literature reviews, and scoping reviews. Traditional literature reviews provide narrative overviews, while SLRs emphasize rigor and reproducibility through structured protocols that minimize bias and ensure transparency (Cherry et al., 2024; Sharma & Goyal, 2023). Scoping reviews, meanwhile, offer a broad assessment of available evidence, helping researchers refine their focus and identify knowledge gaps. These methodologies—when approached with respect for relationality and intentionality—align with both Indigenous values of honoring knowledge and Christian principles of stewardship and service.\nAs you develop as a consumer of research, understanding these methodologies equips you to critically evaluate scholarly work, apply evidence-based practices, and contribute to informed leadership. By incorporating the principles of servant leadership, relational ethics, and the pursuit of truth, researchers can ensure their work serves the needs of their communities while advancing knowledge in meaningful and impactful ways.",

    "text": "Step 1: Clarify Key Concepts (Terminology and Definitions)\nA scoping review is instrumental in clarifying key concepts by helping researchers navigate the terms and definitions prevalent in a field. This is achieved by systematically examining existing literature to identify how terms are used and understood within various contexts. By doing so, researchers can align their research question with the established discourse, ensuring consistency and relevance (Gupta et al., 2023).\nFor example, if a scoping review reveals varying definitions for a term like “student engagement” in K-12 education, ranging from behavioral participation to emotional connection, the researcher can adopt or refine a definition that best suits their study. This alignment sharpens the focus of the research and improves communication with the academic community and stakeholders by using language that resonates with existing frameworks.\nIn some cases, researchers may find that different terms are used interchangeably to describe the same concept. For instance, terms like “student involvement” or “classroom participation” might be used in the literature to refer to aspects of “student engagement.” Recognizing and consolidating these terms under a consistent definition enhances clarity and avoids redundancy.\nAdditionally, as researchers conduct a scoping review, they may encounter terms specific to their narrow area of focus that are new to them. For example, within studies of emotional engagement, a term like “affective attunement” might appear in the context of describing the emotional resonance between students and their learning experiences. Learning these nuanced terms allows researchers to refine their understanding of the research topic and frame their study in a way that is precise and informed by the latest developments in the field.\nBy clarifying key concepts and integrating relevant terminology, researchers set a solid foundation for their study and avoid ambiguity that could hinder the interpretation of findings. This process ensures that their work contributes meaningfully to the academic discourse and is accessible to stakeholders within the field.\n\nActivity: Learning Activity\nAfter reviewing your scoping review, respond to the following questions in your Reflective Journal to help you clarify key concepts:\n\nWhat are the most used terms in the literature related to your research topic, and how are they defined by different authors?\nAre there variations in the usage or interpretation of key terms across different studies or contexts? If so, what might explain these variations?\nDo the definitions of key concepts align with your intended research focus, or do you need to adopt a specific definition or framework?\nSelect 2-3 important terms from the articles you have read that relate to your research topic. For each term, choose a definition from the literature, being sure to cite that definition. (You will include this in your upcoming assignment.)",

    "text": "Step 2: Highlighting Gaps\nA key outcome of a scoping review is its ability to identify gaps in existing literature, which provides a foundation for shaping meaningful and impactful research questions. By systematically mapping the current body of knowledge, scoping reviews reveal areas that are under-researched, inconsistently studied, or where evidence is outdated or conflicting (Pham et al., 2014). This process allows researchers to pinpoint voids in knowledge that require further investigation.\nFor example, a scoping review on digital literacy in K-12 education might reveal an abundance of studies focused on middle and high school students but limited research on elementary-level digital literacy instruction. Recognizing this gap enables the researcher to develop a question specifically addressing digital literacy interventions for younger students. Similarly, gaps in methodology, such as a lack of longitudinal studies or insufficient diversity in sampled populations, can inform the design and scope of future research.\nBy highlighting these gaps, scoping reviews ensure that new research contributes to advancing the field rather than duplicating existing work, while also addressing practical or theoretical needs that have not yet been explored.\n\nActivity: Learning Activity\nAfter conducting your scoping review, respond to following questions in your Reflective Journal to help you systematically examine your findings to uncover gaps and focus your research efforts on areas with the most potential for contribution in your field:\n\nWhich areas related to my research topic have few or no studies addressing them?\nAre there specific populations, settings, or contexts that are under-represented in existing literature?\nAre there inconsistencies or contradictions in the findings across studies that indicate areas requiring further investigation?\nWhat trends or emerging themes in the literature suggest areas where research has not yet kept pace with practical or theoretical developments?\nWhat insights from the literature stand out?",

    "section": "Step 3: Assessing Feasibility",
    "text": "Step 3: Assessing Feasibility\nAssessing the feasibility of a research question involves evaluating whether the question can be practically addressed given the available resources, literature, data, and time constraints for a systematic review. A scoping review is instrumental in this process, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the existing evidence and identifies areas with sufficient data to support research efforts (Pham et al., 2014).\nBy understanding the scope and availability of data, researchers can determine whether their question is too broad, too narrow, or misaligned with existing literature. For example, if the scoping review reveals a lack of empirical studies on a specific intervention, researchers might refine their question to focus on related interventions with more robust evidence. Alternatively, if the review uncovers abundant but heterogeneous data, the research question can be tailored to focus on a specific subset of studies or outcomes that are most relevant.\nThis process ensures that research questions are both actionable and meaningful. Aligning the question with available evidence allows researchers to design studies that are achievable within the scope of their resources, while also contributing valuable insights to the field. Assessing feasibility minimizes wasted effort and increases the likelihood of producing impactful research.\n\nActivity: Learning Activity\nRespond to following questions in your Reflective Journal to help you assess the feasibility of your research question:\n\nDoes the existing literature provide sufficient data to address my research question, or are there significant gaps that may hinder my ability to investigate it?\nIs my research question specific enough to be addressed within the available time, resources, and scope of my study?\nDoes my research question target a manageable scope of literature, avoiding being too broad or too narrow for a systematic review?\n\nNote: Your Journal is not graded but will help you in your assessment for this unit.\n\n\nActivity: Learning Activity\n\nWatch “How to Write a Research Question for Your Literature Review” (Hall, 2019):\nReview the following sample general Research Questions (RQ) and corresponding revised specific Research Questions.

Revised Specific RQ: How do communication strategies used by primary care physicians impact patient satisfaction in urban outpatient clinics?\nGeneral Question: What are the effects of technology on student learning? Revised Specific RQ: How does the use of gamified learning platforms affect math achievement among middle school students in rural schools?\nGeneral Question: What drives employee engagement in organizations? Revised Specific RQ: What is the impact of flexible work policies on employee engagement in technology startups with under 500 employees?\n\nUse the checklist below to critique and revise your initial draft research question:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify Specific Aspects of Interest\n\n\nFrom your review, highlight specific elements that intrigue you. For example, if your broad topic is “leadership in education,” narrow it to aspects such as “the influence of transformational leadership on student engagement.”\n\n\n\n\nClarify Key Concepts\n\n\nIdentify and define the most important concepts and terms in your scoping review. Provide definitions based on how these terms are used in the literature.

    "text": "Citations and Stewardship\nCiting sources aligns closely with the concept of stewardship in servant leadership. Peter Block (1993) defines stewardship as “holding something in trust for another,” (p. xx) a principle that underscores people’s responsibility to care for and respect others’ contributions. In servant leadership, stewardship means leaders hold knowledge, resources, and responsibilities in trust—not for personal gain, but for the benefit of the community and society.\nApplying this principle, citing sources in our work becomes an act of stewardship. You are acknowledging and preserving the intellectual contributions of others and using them in a way that respects their origin and purpose. Just as servant leaders use openness and persuasion over control, citations allow people to transparently share ideas, enabling others to trace, verify, and build upon those ideas for the collective good. This practice reflects a commitment to serve the academic and professional communities by fostering a culture of respect, integrity, and shared knowledge.",

    "text": "Citations and Indigenous Storytelling\nIn Indigenous storytelling, stewardship and proper acknowledgment are essential aspects of preserving and respecting knowledge. Land acknowledgments are an important practice in recognizing Indigenous stewardship and the original keepers of the land (Hanson, 2009). For example, you may notice the land acknowledgement on the course syllabus:\n\n“We acknowledge that Trinity Western University, Langley campus is located on the traditional ancestral unceded territory of the Stó:lō people.”\nThis practice reflects the values of respect and responsibility toward those who have historically cared for and continue to care for the land.\nSimilarly, Indigenous oral traditions are rich with stories passed down through generations, where each storyteller holds a piece of collective memory and knowledge in trust, as noted by Elders and knowledge keepers. This stewardship of knowledge is not just about the storyteller; it is about honoring the voices and wisdom of those who came before (Hanson, 2009).\nJust as citing sources in academic work gives credit to the original thinkers, land acknowledgments recognize Indigenous peoples as the rightful stewards of the land. This practice emphasizes respect and gratitude (Hanson, 2009), connecting to Peter Block’s (1993) idea of stewardship as “holding something in trust for another,” (p. xx) recognizing the historical and ongoing relationship Indigenous Peoples have with the land. Additionally, just as citing a source respects the intellectual property of others, acknowledging original knowledge keepers of an Indigenous story honors those who have preserved this wisdom over generations.\nCitations in Western academia give credit, while in Indigenous traditions, “oral footnoting” attributes the story to a specific elder or ancestor, reflecting the storyteller’s responsibility to the collective memory (Hanson, 2009). This act of stewardship, both in academic and Indigenous contexts, upholds a culture of respect, ensuring that knowledge is shared ethically, responsibly, and for the benefit of future generations.\n\nActivity: Learning Activity: Citations\nPractice formatting APA 7 in-text citations by solving a puzzle using the correct citation style for paraphrased and direct quotes.

    "text": "References\nAs Indigenous storytelling practices and academic citations embody stewardship and foster a culture of sharing knowledge responsibly and respectfully, so do references. Like using citations, including references is another way to practice servant leadership in written communication.\nA shift toward servant leadership in organizations today reflects a movement away from traditional, hierarchical structures to one rooted in ethical, compassionate, and inclusive leadership (Spears, 2010). This approach, defined by principles like stewardship, empathy, and commitment to the growth of others (Spears, 2010), aligns deeply with the practice of using APA references in academic and professional writing. APA referencing allows people to ethically credit original thinkers and contributors, building trust and transparency in their work. From a servant leadership perspective, using citations is an act of stewardship; It involves holding knowledge in trust for others, using it responsibly, and ensuring that ideas are shared openly for the benefit of the entire community.\nAPA references also embody key servant leadership traits, such as commitment to the growth of others and building community. By providing accurate references, we not only acknowledge the efforts of others but also empower our readers to explore the original sources, deepening their understanding and engagement with the topic. This aligns with servant leadership’s dedication to individual growth and the creation of a collaborative, knowledge-sharing environment (Spears, 2010). In this way, references help build a community of learning, where ideas circulate ethically and openly.\nFurther, servant leaders rely on awareness and foresight, seeing the broader impacts of their actions on others (Spears, 2010). By referencing sources, writers exercise these qualities, understanding that their work does not stand alone but is part of a larger discourse. This approach supports a responsible, forward-thinking culture where ideas are treated with respect and integrity, creating a positive and ethical academic and professional environment.\n\nActivity: Learning Activity: References Formatting Puzzle\nPractice formatting references according to APA 7 guidelines by solving a puzzle that involves properly formatting citations for journals, books, and web sources.

Explain why they are relevant to your research interest.\nResearch Topic: Next, include the following three statements to clarify what you want to address in your question. If you can complete these statements, you will have a narrow enough topic, with enough direction, to perform some great research.\n\n\nI am researching ____________________________________ (What? Topic)\nbecause I want to find out _________________________ (So What? Issue/question)\nin order to ________________________________ (Now What? Application/Purpose).\n\n\nResearch Question & Rationale: Write the research question you want to pursue for your capstone project. Write a 2-3 paragraph rationale for why you chose this question. Discuss why this topic is important to you.\n\n\nBe sure your Research Question (RQ) is formatted as a question.\nCheck your RQ to be sure it is specific and that it can be answered through research. Be aware that you will likely refine your research question by the end of this course.\n\n\nReferences: Include an APA 7 formatted reference list.\n\nAPA 7: Be sure to use APA formatting for all in-text citations and references.",
