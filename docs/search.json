    "text": "1.1 What is Scholarly Inquiry?\nInquiry is ‚Äúthe process of developing skills to arrive at understandings of a problem, an issue, or a phenomenon, through the process of asking good questions, searching out good evidence, and arriving at well-reasoned conclusions‚Äù (Penner, 2017).\nBy now you are well aware of the applied nature of the MA in Leadership program. This feature may be an important part of what attracted you to the program! Why then study research methods? Why worry about scholarly inquiry? This course in scholarly inquiry will help you to develop systematic thinking skills applicable in all realms of leadership and everyday life. As Rosch, Kniffin, and Guthrie (2023) note, research focuses our professional knowledge, to inform your leader-centric, group-centric, and context-centric to guide the broader view of our leadership position and contributes to our ocverall leadership practice (p.¬†23). Moreover, our leadership practice is ideally evidence-based; that is, based on evidence derived from systematic scholarly inquiry.\n\n1.1.1 Learning Activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015), ‚Äúresearch is a process of steps used to collect and analyze information in order to increase our knowledge about a topic or an issue‚Äù (p.4) and it is different then informal research.\nüì∫ To begin this learning activity, watch the following video where Jane Hammons explains ‚ÄúTeaching Research as Inquiry‚Äù.\n\nüìñ Read Chapters 1 and 2 of the Rosch et al.¬†(2023) text.\n‚úèÔ∏è Start a Reflective Learning Journal.

    "text": "1.2 Introduction to the Reflective Journal\nA reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. There is no correct way to create this journal; rather, it is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning. Journals can consist of traditional note taking on paper, or in a word document, you can create mind maps, pictures, or just write stream-of-consciousness, you can record your thoughts in an audio file, write down important quotes, create sketches, or drawings: whatever you choose to include. Experiment and have fun.\nThe purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the course‚Äôs readings, activities, and discussions with your instructor and your fellow students. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work.\nThroughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even outside of our scheduled course activities.\n\nCommon Questions Used for Reflective Journaling\n\nIn your view, what were the most important points in the readings, videoclips, or discussions with your fellow students and tutors?\nWhat information did you already know?\nWhat new knowledge, ideas, or perspectives have you gained?\nWhat information was easy to remember or learn? Why?\nWhat concepts did you find more difficult? Why?\nHow can you apply this knowledge to your work or current experience?\nHow has this knowledge helped you to make sense of your current or previous experience?\nHas your understanding of a personal or work-related situation changed after studying these concepts?\nDid you agree or disagree with any of the material? If yes, how did you react and why?\nIf you could have the opportunity to engage in further learning, what would it be?\nWhat further questions would like to ask the author of your readings?\nWhat other articles, books or discussions would be of interest?\n\n\nThis journal is not submitted or graded, but is an opportunity for you to reflect on, and engage with, the course content. The questions posed will often help you prepare for your assignments and are designed to help you successfully achieve the learning outcomes for each unit.",

    "section": "1.3 Leadership and Scholarly Inquiry",
    "text": "1.3 Leadership and Scholarly Inquiry\nOn what basis are sound decisions made? What evidence do leaders rely upon for best outcomes? The need to evaluate evidence for best practices in leadership decision-making is widely acknowledged. Patton (2001) observes that ‚Äúthe emphasis on knowledge generation disseminated in the form of best practices has swept like wildfire through all sectors of society‚Äù (p.¬†329).\nWe often refer to the vision of best practices in leadership within the MA in Leadership program. What do we mean by this? Put simply, ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù refers to those practices and initiatives that result in the best possible outcomes. How do we know what best practice is? The process of identifying best practices begins with an understanding of common sources of evidence available to leaders.\nTake a moment to think about a recent decision you made as a leader. On what did you base this decision? Previous experience? Values? Company policy? Empirical evidence (e.g., data derived from research)? Expert opinion? Systematic inquiry (as represented by research) is one tool that leaders can use to inform best practices and their decision making process.\nSystematic inquiry is hardly new ‚Äì in first century writings we see in the Bible evidence of systematic, logical, and empirical inquiry. Consider the following passage from Luke, a physician trained in empirical methods of his day:\n\nMany have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. (Luke 1:1-4, NIV)\n\nHow does the research process differ from managerial activities such as decision-making and problem solving? Research shares with decision-making and problem-solving the systematic and disciplined procedure of identifying an issue/problem, deciding on an approach, formulating a plan, collecting and analyzing data, drawing conclusions and implementing decisions based on this rigorous process. What distinguishes research from generic or everyday problem solving is its commitment to advance or generate knowledge that typically will be communicated to the larger academic or scientific community. The past two decades have produced remarkable growth in the area of foundations of research and research methodologies within natural, applied, and social sciences and humanities.\n\nBoyer‚Äôs Model of Scholarship\nThe Master of Arts in Leadership program is focused on applied scholarship. In defining this, Boyer‚Äôs four-part Model of Scholarship (1997) is useful. Boyer‚Äôs typology identifies four domains of scholarship: discovery, integration, application, and teaching. The model is discussed by Marta Nibert (2011) in her paper titled Boyer‚Äôs Model of Scholarship. In the section titled Application she notes that the scholarship of\n\n. . . application, focuses on using research findings and innovations to remedy societal problems. Included in this category are service activities that are specifically tied to one‚Äôs field of knowledge and professional activities. Beneficiaries of these activities include commercial entities, non-profit organizations, and professional associations. (para. 4)\n\nThough Nibert‚Äôs primary audience is the professoriate, this material is relevant for MA in Leadership learners. Application is highlighted because the Master of Arts in Leadership was designed to focus primarily on the scholarship of application, although work in the capstone will likely include one or more of the other domains.\nBoyer‚Äôs Scholarship of Discovery is the type of scholarship associated with traditional scholarly research. ‚ÄúResearch is a systematic process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting information (data) in order to increase our understanding of a phenomenon abut which we are interested or concerned‚Äù (Leedy & Ormrod 2010, p.¬†2).\nBoyer‚Äôs Scholarship of Discovery is often referred to as primary research. Primary research is narrowly focused, and contributes to the body of knowledge by helping us to understand one isolated part of reality in detail in the hopes that this understanding can be generalized to some degree to a broader part of reality. The Scholarship of Discovery (in traditional research) falls into two distinct genres: quantitative research and qualitative research. Each of these genres manifest in numerous variations, including hybrid models involving both quantitative and qualitative elements, designed for and suited to differing research questions.\nBoyer‚Äôs Scholarship of Integration is ‚Äúthe attempt to arrange relevant bits of knowledge and insight from different disciplines into broader patterns that reflect the actual interconnectedness of the world‚Äù (Boyer cited in Jacobsen & Jacobsen, 2004, p.¬†51). Scholarship of Integration often demands interdisciplinary collaboration and requires that the critical analysis and review of knowledge be followed by the creative synthesis of views and insights in such a way that what is known speaks to specific topics or issues.\nThe Scholarship of Application is ‚Äúthe scholarship of engagement; seeking to close the gap between values in the academy and the needs of the larger world‚Äù (Boyer cited in Jacobsen & Jacobsen, 2004, p.¬†51). In the Scholarship of Application, knowledge is applied to the solution of societal needs and practice. In most cases, knowledge stemming from the Scholarship of Discovery and the Scholarship of Integration informs the solutions to particular problems. The Scholarships of Discovery and Integration are often associated with the context of formal education. The Scholarship of Application may happen within formal education contexts, it is most often associated with other settings (Bosher 2009, p.¬†6).\nFinally, the Scholarship of Teaching is ‚Äúthe scholarship of sharing knowledge‚Äù (Boyer cited in Jacobsen & Jacobsen, 2004, p.¬†51). The Scholarship of Teaching involves the reflective analysis of the knowledge about teaching and learning. This knowledge base itself is the product of the Scholarships of Discovery, Integration and Application combining as ‚Äúactive ingredients of a dynamic and iterative teaching process‚Äù (Bosher, 2009, p.¬†5).\nBoyer‚Äôs typology originally identified as the Scholarship of Teaching has been expanded somewhat and is widely known today in the literature as the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (Bosher, 2009). You have undoubtedly already noticed an ambiguity: If the entire model is called the Scholarship of Teaching, how is it that the last element depicted in the chart above is also called the Scholarship of Teaching? This ambiguity is evident, Bosher contends that Boyer‚Äôs four domains were conceived holistically as elements that overlap and interact, not as discrete elements, appearing in any predictable order, and are better viewed as an operating system than a list of discrete elements (2009, pp.¬†4-5).\n\n\n1.3.1 Learning Activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüì∫ Watch the following video where Dr.¬†Patton introduces you to the concept of research as a scholar-practitioner.\n‚úèÔ∏è Next, answer the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal.**\n\nDescribe at least one example of a decision you have made as a leader.\nConsider the factors that went into that decision making process (e.g., values, research, policy, past experience, expert opinion).\nWhat do you consider as ‚Äúevidence‚Äù in your decision making?\nIn your own words, why is evidence-based decision-making important in leadership?\n\nNote that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit.",

    "section": "1.4 Philosophical Foundations of Research",
    "text": "1.4 Philosophical Foundations of Research\nA professor of mine often observed that a fundamental attribute of being human is to ask questions. Humanity is especially interested in three fundamental questions: What is real? What is true? What is good? The philosophical category of metaphysics is concerned with what is real, and what is the nature of reality. The philosophical category of epistemology is concerned with what is true, and what is the nature and process of knowing. The philosophical category of axiology is concerned with what is good and how we can determine the nature of goodness. Much of history is a chronicle of the different ways people have answered these three fundamental questions. How we answer these questions reveals our perspective, or our worldview.\nEvery person bases his or her own thoughts, decisions, and actions on what is called a worldview. A worldview is ‚Äúan interpretive framework through which one makes sense of themselves, other people, and the world around them‚Äù (Geisler & Watkins, 2003). It is like a pair of glasses that you wear when you are observing things about yourself, other people and the world in which you live. Here is a short video by the Impact 360 Institute (2014) that explains ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your worldview?‚Äù\n\nA discussion about worldview, or your perspective, is foundational to what we want to accomplish in this course. Throughout this course I will ask these questions: On what basis are sound decisions made? What evidence do leaders rely upon for best outcomes when they are making decisions? Each of us has a preference for obtaining truth or a framework for understanding ourselves, others, and the world, and personal preferences abound. Researchers and consumers of research (i.e.¬†us) approach knowledge and learning and life with a certain perspective and it is important to understand that perspective before you jump into the research journey and it is certainly something to consider in positions of leadership.\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1.1: Image Source: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40670-019-00898-9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Paradigms\n\n\n\nHere is a really helpful video by Laura Killam (2013) that explains Paradigms, Ontology and Epistemology.\n\nIt is important to be aware of your worldview before you enter into the research journey because it will inform the types of questions that you ask as well as the processes that you use to find the answers to your questions. As an example, let me explain a Christian worldview and explore how this worldview can be applied to the research journey.\nA Christian worldview asserts that God has created the world and everything in it, and that truth is arrived at through a study of God‚Äôs specific revelation (the Bible) and general revelation (creation). Christians believe not only in studying and understanding truth, but they also believe in a personal God that has revealed Himself through this created world.\nThe Christian worldview can be summarized in three words: Creation, Fall and Redemption. Let me unpack these terms. Initially, when God created the world, it was all good and whole and harmonious. God created man in His own image. Originally man was created healthy in body, soul and spirit (Genesis 1:26-27, 31). As people rebelled against God, causing the Fall, the presence of sin corrupted all aspects of God‚Äôs good creation, and brought about much suffering. Where there was formerly harmony and wholeness, we now experience ourselves, our relationships and the world around us as fractured, broken and full of dis-ease (a literal discomfort with who we are) (Genesis 3).\nDespite the brokenness, Christians believe that God is actively working to bring about restoration and wholeness to His entire creation. Through Christ‚Äôs redemptive work on the cross, people are reconciled to God and are challenged to make all things as they were created and meant to be ‚Äì very good. Redemption means that all things are made new in Christ (Colossians 1:19-20).\nThe framework of Creation, Fall and Redemption is important because it allows us to enter into a discussion about research with confidence knowing that God‚Äôs redemptive work touches this area. Christians believe that we are called to study creation with the desire to take the knowledge we gain and use it to help and bless others; to work toward the restoration and healing of God‚Äôs creation. Christians are called to inquire, to investigate, to ask questions, always with a view to serve others.\nIt is beyond the purpose of this course to go deeper into this topic other than to make the point that our way of knowing and understanding the world around us (i.e., our worldview) influences how we approach all of life, including how we approach research and how we use research to inform our decision-making process.",

    "section": "1.5 The Research Process",
    "text": "1.5 The Research Process\nPlano-Clark and Creswell (2015) define research as ‚Äúa process of steps used to collect and analyze information in order to increase our knowledge about a topic or issue‚Äù (p.¬†4). Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) identify eight steps in the research process which provide us with a useful framework that describes what researchers do when they conduct their studies. These steps help us understand the information that is included in their reports. Listed below are each of the eight steps in the research process.\n\nThe whole process begins with identifying the research problem. This step is vitally important. The statement of the research problem is the very foundation that subsequent research is built upon, and quite literally guides each and every step moving forward.\nA literature review is a summary of the ‚Äústate of knowledge‚Äù in a given area. This step is the primary focus of this course and involves locating relevant scholarly literature, and analyzing, synthesizing and summarizing what precedent literature has to say about a specific topic.\nThe purpose of research includes identifying the objective of a study (e.g., purpose statement). This information is typically expressed in a few research questions or hypotheses.\nNext, it is important to choose a research design. This step involves describing an overall plan or approach of the study and also explains the methods used to carry out the plan.\nSelecting participants and collecting data includes who will be the participants, how you will collect information from those participants, and what permission you need to obtain in order to collect the information.\nAnalyzing data involves systematic processes to make sense of the information that has been gathered. We call this process ‚Äúresults,‚Äù which are then reported in forms appropriate to the research method (e.g., statistics or words).\nDrawing conclusions means interpreting the results and explaining how the conclusions relate to the research questions/hypotheses, and/or similar studies. There is also a discussion of limitations of the study and often suggestions of implications for the intended audiences, for practice and for future research.\nDisseminating and evaluating the research. Usually the term ‚Äúdisseminated‚Äù means ‚Äúpublished.‚Äù The most common way that research is disseminated is in journals dedicated to publishing primary research.\n\n\n1.5.1 Learning Activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüì∫ Begin this learning activity by watching the following video where Gary Gramenz explain Philosophical Foundations for Research Methodology. https://www.youtube.com /watch?v=j758XBXD4r4\nNext, read the following articles:\nüìñ Wallace (2007).

Then answer the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal.\n\nWhat motivates you? What are you driven by? (e.g.¬†funding, social justice, the common good)\nDo you believe there is ‚Äúone verifiable reality,‚Äù or that ‚Äúmultiple socially constructed realities‚Äù exist?\nWhat do you think counts as knowledge within the world?\nHow do you think knowledge acquired?\nBased on the Brown and Duenas article, what research paradigm resonates with you the most?

    "section": "1.6 Asking Significant Questions",
    "text": "1.6 Asking Significant Questions\nThe most important part of the research process is beginning with a good research question. This is something that will be highly relevant to completing of most of your assignments in this course.\nThe research process often starts when you ask a question about something that you observe: How, What, When, Who, Which, Why, or Where? Questions can be based on what you observe in the real world, or on intuition or a ‚Äúgut feeling‚Äù.\nThe question that you select is the cornerstone of your work in this course. The assignments you will be working on will revolve around finding an answer to the question you are posing. It is important to select a question that is going to be interesting to work on for the length of this course and a question that is specific enough to allow you to find the answer.\nThe Higher Education Academy and Sheffield Hallam University (2005) have developed an excellent guide for Formulating the Research Question. According to the authors, good questions are:\nRelevant: The question will be of interest to people in your field and arise from issues raised in the literature or in practice. You should be able to establish a clear purpose for your research in relation to the chosen field. For example, are you filling a gap in knowledge, analyzing professional practice, monitoring a development in practice, comparing different approaches?\nManageable: The question you ask must be within your ability to tackle. For example, are you able to access people, statistics, or documents from which to collect the data you need to address the question fully? Can this data be accessed within the limited time and resources you have available to you? Sometimes a research question appears feasible, but when you start your literature review, it proves otherwise.\nSubstantial and (within reason) original: The question should not simply copy questions asked in other papers. It shows your own imagination and your ability to construct and develop research issues. And it needs to give sufficient scope to develop into a research paper.\nClear and simple: Getting this clear and thought-through is one of the hardest parts of your work. If you create a clear and simple research question, you may find that it becomes more complex as you think about the situation you are studying and undertake the literature review.\nInteresting: This is key! The question needs to be one that interests you and is likely to remain intriguing for the duration of the project. There are two traps to be avoided. Make sure that you have a real, grounded interest in your research question, and that you can explore this in an academic paper. It is your interest that will motivate you to keep working and to produce a good research paper.\n\n1.6.1 Learning Activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Master of Arts in Leadership program values the application of best practices to your personal and professional practice. Before we get into some of the concrete realities of accessing scholarly literature, we would like you to take time to reflect on and articulate some of the salient leadership interests in your personal and professional life and practice. At the end of the MA Leadership program (in LDRS 697 & 698) you will get an opportunity to create a project based on a salient leadership problem/interest. It is good to start thinking about what the topic may be now so that you can use the assignments in this course to start preparing for your final project.\nüì∫ Begin this learning activity by watching the following video about asking significant questions:\nWatch: Systematic Reviewing Workshop Part 2: Formulating a Research Question\n\n‚úèÔ∏è Take time to answer the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal.\n\nWhere do you see the greatest need for change in the field you want to work as a leader?\nWhat would you propose to change in your field and why?\n\nTry using the following three statements to help you get some clarity about what exactly you want to investigate. If you can fill out these statements, then you most likely have a narrow enough topic with enough direction to perform some great research.\n\nI am researching ____________ (What? Topic) because I want to find out ________ (So What? Issue/question) in order to ________ (Now What? Application/Purpose).\n\nNote that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit.\n(Source: The Research Problem/Question - Organizing Your Social Sciences Research Paper - Research Guides at University of Southern California)",

    "text": "2.1 Accessing Scholarly Literature\nIn this unit you will be exploring the topic ‚ÄúAccessing and Evaluating Scholarly Literature‚Äù. This unit will help you gain familiarity with various genres of scholarly literature and help you get a sense of what scholarly sources of information are available, given your own research interests. In this unit you will also gain first-hand experience in locating and organizing and evaluating relevant scholarly literature.\nThe learning activities in this unit will walk you through some very practical readings and video tutorials on how to access and evaluate scholarly literature. Let‚Äôs begin!\nAccessing scholarly literature can be a frustrating process. The key is to start at the beginning with a good plan and keep yourself organized. Organizing tools are important both to streamline your literature search and to summarize and synthesize. As you begin your literature search (library books, online periodicals, internet search), organize your search into general topic areas and more specific keywords. It is very helpful to have some sense of the various fields that will potentially inform your research interests.\nPart of your planning and organizing is to recognize various genres of scholarly literature and to be aware of the limitations inherent to each.\nThere are three different categories of documents where you can find research reports: summaries and books, journal articles and early stage materials such as conference presentations. Many times you will see this sequence followed: A research project is completed, and the research is first published in a Mater‚Äôs thesis or PhD dissertation, or as a paper in a symposium or conference. The research report then goes to a professional journal for publication and eventually it is incorporated into a book. By the time a dissertation is successfully defended, the actual research may have been conducted two to three years earlier. It could easily take another three years for a journal article to make it through the peer-review process and be published. Therefore, the research referenced in the journal article could be at least five years old. It could easily take another five years for high quality publishers to work through their review processes and publish something in a book. Obviously, what you lose in this process is cutting edge thought.\nThe chart below summarizes the relative advantages and disadvantages of each genre of scholarly literature. You can refer to Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) pages 10-12 for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenre\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nUtility\n\n\n\n\nSummaries (encyclopedias and handbooks)\nGenerally highest quality.\nTend to be dated.\nEstablish a general working knowledge of the field.\n\n\nBooks\nGenerally high quality.\nCan be dated.\nEstablish mainstream thought. Most foundational literature is found in books.\n\n\nJournal Articles\nGenerally high quality.* Provide a clear description of actual research. Generally more current than books or summaries.\nGenerally will not give a full development of application and implications.\nBest available balance between quality and currency.\n\n\nEarly stage materials (conference papers, dissertations, newspapers, personal websites etc.)\nMost current cutting edge ideas are found here.\nLittle review for quality (except for dissertations). Ideas are not usually well developed.\nValuable for establishing trends in current thought. Use cautiously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: High quality journals are determined by the peer review process, the journals impact factor (IF) and by professional reputation. The impact factor is a measure of the frequency with which the average article in a journal has been cited in a particular year. The IF is used to measure the importance or rank of a journal by calculating the times its articles are cited. The IF can be found on the home page of most online journals.\nPeer review is the process used by publishers and editors of academic/scholarly journals to ensure that the articles they publish meet the accepted standards of their discipline. Manuscripts being considered for publication are sent to independent experts in the same field (the author‚Äôs scholarly or scientific peers). They evaluate the quality of the scholarship, reliability of findings, relevance to the field, appropriateness for the journal, etc.\nRosch, Kniffen, and Guthrie (2023) provide useful tip sregarding what sources of literature you should access. They suggest discovering your purpose through what you observe in daily life, identifying p[ractical issues, past and current research, and becoming aware of significant theories in the broader field of study (p.¬†41). As a general rule, articles published within the past 10 years should give you a good idea of what is current in your profession.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read, and Search for Journal Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüìñ Read chapters 13 and 14 in the Rosch, Kniffin & Guthrie (2023) text. These two chapters discuss ‚ÄòBecoming a critical scholar‚Äô and ‚ÄòA lifetime of learning in leadership.‚Äô\nüì∫ Watch the tutorial\n\nClick on the library link ‚ÄúHow to search for articles.‚Äù Begin by selecting one of video tutorials in the section on multi-disciplinary databases such as https://vimeo.com/160918763/913f61489b\n\nWatch the video tutorial to get an idea of how to search for a topic in a multi-disciplinary database.\nüìñ Keeping in mind the topic and specific question(s) you identified in Assignment 1, use the Academic Search Ultimate database at the TWU library to locate a good example of a journal article. To do this you will need to:\n\nGo to the TWU library home page.\nIn the first search window, click the databases tab and then click the articles and databases link which brings you to a different screen.\nIn the Database Guide screen you will need to select ‚ÄúA-B‚Äù from the A-Z list of databases at the bottom of this page.\nThe first database that appears on the next screen is ‚ÄúAcademic Search Ultimate.‚Äù Select this database.\nYou will be asked to sign in as a student with your pass ID and password to access the online database.\nOnce you have signed in, then you will be able to type your topic or question in the search window of ‚ÄúAcademic Search Ultimate.‚Äù\n\nSearching for Books\n\nGo to TWU library homepage and click ‚ÄúHow to search for books‚Äù.\nBegin by selecting one of video tutorials in the section ‚Äúsearching for e-books‚Äù such as ‚Äúsearching for e-books in the classic catalogue.‚Äù Watch the video tutorial to get an idea of how to search for a topic found in an e-book.\nKeeping in mind the topic and specific question(s) you identified in Assignment 1, use the library catalog to locate a good example of an e-book.\n\n‚úèÔ∏è Answer the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal.\n\nBriefly describe your experiences in the search for a journal and an e-book, what worked well, what did not, what key search terms did you use, what databases did you search?\n\nNote that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit.",

    "section": "2.2 Utilizing Scholarly Literature",
    "text": "2.2 Utilizing Scholarly Literature\nAfter you have determined what sources you will be accessing, you need to conduct a search, and then keep track of your literature search strategy and results. The simplest way to do this is to use an online reference manager that will help you collect, organize, cite and share your references according to the referencing style you will be using. There are several free, online reference managers available such as Refworks, Zotero, and EndNote. TWU library has a research guide that describes how to use EndNote. This library guide will help you sign up for an EndNote account and also help you figure out how to use EndNote to download and store your citations in folders and then input citations into Word documents and create reference lists.\nAfter you have retrieved the results from your database searches and organized them in folders in your reference manager, you need to select documents to review. Begin by reviewing the titles and abstracts. For those articles that you deem worthwhile, skim the article itself to determine if it is relevant to your topic. Read the introduction and literature review and examine the reference list.\nAs you collect relevant literature you can either enter it into a summary chart or just collect the abstracts. There is no single correct way to do this‚Äîbut you will need to develop some sort of system that works for you. An example of a summary chart is provided below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nReference\nCite full reference in APA (6th edition) format for a reference list.\n\n\nResearch Problem\nDescribe the research problem and relevant background information. Include page references for both your summaries and direct quotations.\n\n\nPurpose, Research question or Hypothesis\nDescribe the purpose, research question and hypothesis. Include page references for summaries and quotations.\n\n\nData Collection/Procedure\nDescribe how the researcher collected data. What participants did they use? What measures did they use? What method was used?\n\n\nResults/Findings\nDescribe the results or findings.\n\n\n\nThe research process is not always linear. You may have a great research question or research topic in mind, but as you begin your initial database and library searches you may find yourself changing or refining your topic. Sometimes you will not find any information on the topic you have chosen because the topic is so new and no one has done any research on the topic yet. Sometimes you will not find any information on the topic you have chosen because you are not using the right search terms or keywords.\nIf you are having difficulty finding research articles and books on your topic then try to re-examine the keywords you are using for your search. Look up synonyms for your keywords and try to find the terms that are used in the research literature. Another helpful tip is to look at the reference list of any articles or books that seem closest to your topic. This can help you to see what sources other authors have used and can be a helpful strategy to track down articles and books on your topic.\n\n2.2.1 Learning Activity: Read, Watch and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüìñ Begin this learning activity by reading Chapter 6 of the Fredericksen and Phelps (n.d.) text.\nüì∫ Next, go to the TWU library homepage and click ‚ÄúHow to develop research skills.‚Äù Begin by watching all of the video tutorials under the section ‚Äúupgrading your research skills.‚Äù There are several short videos in this section on Boolean searches, search history, and other search techniques.\n‚úèÔ∏è Answer the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal.\n\nBriefly describe your experiences with upgrading your research skills.\nWhat did you find worked well, what did not?\nWhat boolean searches did you use, what inclusion or exclusion criteria did you select?\n\nNote that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit.",

    "section": "2.3 Evaluating Scholarly Literature",
    "text": "2.3 Evaluating Scholarly Literature\nAfter you have found several articles and books related to your research topic and skimmed them for relevance, the next step is to evaluate your information sources. Unfortunately, not all information that you will come across is going to be credible and reliable. Just because you find articles and books at the library does not mean that the information will be accurate or of high quality.\nAs an MA Leadership student, and as a professional, it is imperative that you are able to critically evaluate information you are reading in order to conduct quality research yourself, inform policies and improve your professional practice. To evaluate a source for quality and credibility you need to consider the following:\n\nAuthority: Who is the author? What are the author‚Äôs credentials (educational background, past writing experience, expertise on the topic)? Is the author‚Äôs name cited in other sources or reference lists? A simple google search will help you explore these questions.\nCurrency: When was the source published? Is the source current or out of date for your topic? Remember the general rule is to use sources that have been published within the past 10 years.\nPurpose: What is the author‚Äôs intention? Is the information the author‚Äôs opinion or is the author communicating evidence-based results? Who is the author‚Äôs intended audience? Is it the academic community or consumers? Is the author‚Äôs point of view objective and impartial? Is the language in the article or book free of emotion or bias?\nContent: What kind of information is provided in the article or book? Is it a research article, popular book or opinion piece on a blog? Is the information provided backed up with references or sources? What is the length of the reference list?\nPublication type/process: Who published the source? Was the source peer-reviewed? Is the publisher a university press or a large reputable publisher? Is it from a government agency? Is the source self-published?\nBias and special interests: According to Panucci and Williams (2010) bias can occur during all phases of research from design, implementation, and analysis to publication. Therefore, careful attention to the interpretation of research results and study design will help identify bias. Driscoll and Brizee (2017) suggest that when it comes to publishing research reports, ‚Äúmost major publishers are out to make a profit and will either not cater to special interest groups or will clearly indicate when they are catering to special interest groups‚Äù.\n\n\nAdditional Sources for Finding Scholarly Literature:\nI also wanted to mention two other sources of information that you can use to gather information on your research topic. The first is viewing the TED talk videos. These videos are a great resource to help you become familiar with a researcher and their work on a specific topic. You can search almost any topic on the TED website, the videos are usually under 20 minutes, and are very good. You can find TED site here: https://www.ted.com.\nThe second resource is using the reference lists at the back of a book or of a journal article on your topic. These are both great places to find additional sources of information on your topic and also help you become familiar with who is publishing information in your area of interest.\n\n\n2.3.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read, and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüì∫ Begin this learning activity by watching the following video that explains how to evaluate your sources.\nWatch: How to Evaluate Sources\n\nüìñ Next, read chapter 6: Evaluating Sources in the Fredericksen and Phelps (n.d.) text.\nüì∫ Next, watch the following videos:\nWatch: Assessing Online Resources\n\nand\nWatch: Evaluating a journal article\n\n‚úèÔ∏è Answer the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal at the bottom of this page.\n\nBriefly describe how you found your online sources and whether or not you think they will be helpful resources for your topic.\nWhat sources of information will you use the most to conduct research on your topic?\nHow will you evaluate these sources to make sure they are credible and reliable sources of information?\n\nNote that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit.",

    "text": "3.1 Developing Your Scholarly Voice\nIn Unit 3 you will be discovering how to develop your professional scholarly voice, specifically through your scholarly writing. This means that you will be reading content that will help you understand that there are different writing styles that are used in the world of academia and how important it is to use APA style in the MA Lead program.\nYour learning activities this week are focused on applying the APA standards for general aspects of writing, mechanics of writing and citing sources. You will also have a chance to apply these skills in literature search, scholarly article critique, and formal literature review. Let‚Äôs get started!\nWhen you are asked to write a scholarly paper in graduate school, what you are really being asked to do is to develop your professional voice (McDonald, 2011). A professional voice can be described as utilizing formal language, good vocabulary and appropriate tone in your written and oral communication (Walden University Writing Center, 2017). Characteristics of a strong professional voice are writing concisely, with clarity and precision, and appropriately citing your sources (McDonald, 2011).\nDeveloping your professional voice is important because some students will turn their papers into professional manuscripts that will be submitted to a journal or a book. Some students may be asked to present their work at a professional conference. McDonald suggests that ‚Äúfor most students, writing papers in graduate school is an exercise in presenting important information in an easy to understand and concise way‚Äù (p.125).\nA well developed professional voice can also benefit you in your professional context. For example, at work you may be asked to write a briefing document for your school or hospital board, or you may be asked to share your ideas with other professionals at a conference, or you may be asked to write a grant to fund your organization‚Äôs new project. These are just three examples of professional situations where it is important to have a well-developed professional voice so that you can communicate in a clear and concise way.\nIn order to communicate well, you need to have a system to organize your thoughts so that the information you are writing is presented in an organized and clear manner. There are a wide variety of publication styles that are employed today in universities and in scholarly publications. A few that you may be familiar with are Chicago style, MLA style, Turbian style and APA style. The American Psychological Association (APA) has developed a writing style that is used to establish a standard of written communication. This standard includes: the organization of content, writing style or writing mechanics, citing references, and how to prepare a manuscript for publication in certain disciplines (APA, 2010). The MA Leadership program uses the APA Manual (7th edition) as the model for formatting written work formally submitted.\nAside from simplifying the work of your instructors by having everyone use the same format for a given paper, using APA style makes it easier for readers to understand a text by providing a familiar structure they can follow. Abiding by APA‚Äôs standards as a writer will allow you to:\n\nProvide readers with cues they can use to follow your ideas more efficiently.\nProvide readers with dates of publications to help them locate current information that may be of interest to them.\nAllow readers to focus more on your ideas by not distracting them with unfamiliar formatting.\nEstablish your credibility in the field by demonstrating an awareness of your audience and their needs as fellow researchers.\n\n\n3.1.1 Learning Activity: Watch and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüì∫ In this learning activity you will begin by watching the following video ‚ÄúThe Power of Writing‚Äù by Dr.¬†Jordan Peterson. In the video, Dr.¬†Peterson explains the importance of writing.\n* Watch: Jordan Peterson on the Power of Writing*\n\n‚úèÔ∏è Answer the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal.\n\nWhat is your previous experience with APA style?\nDiscuss why you think scholarly writing could be important in your leadership context.\n\nNote that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit.",

    "section": "3.2 What is Scholarly Writing?",
    "text": "3.2 What is Scholarly Writing?\nAccording to Heady (2013), graduate-level (or scholarly) writing is ‚Äúclear, correct and concise, but it adds the elements of originality and discipline specific expertise‚Äù (p.¬†2). Heady suggests that graduate-level writing explores a topic or a research question in an original way, demonstrates extensive research done on the topic, has a strong organizational structure, and is written for a professional audience. The scholarly writer writes in a way that is skillful, engaging and organized well so that the paper moves from point to point allowing the reader to follow in a logical progression. Heady also states that ‚Äúa good paper has a clear and obvious structure: you can enter it through a clear, well-composed introduction, you move from section to section, and you exit where you know you have been and what you have seen‚Äù (p.¬†73).\n\nCritical Thinking\nOne of the distinguishing features of scholarly writing is the practice of critical thinking. Critical thinking is ‚Äúthat mode of thinking ‚Äî about any subject, content, or problem ‚Äî in which the thinker improves the quality of his or her thinking by skillfully analyzing, assessing and reconstructing it‚Äù (Foundation for Critical Thinking, 2015). In addition, critical thinking also involves creating new and original information, conclusions and ideas (Heady, 2013). Scholarly writing, should reflect higher levels of learning. According to Bloom‚Äôs (1956) taxonomy there are six levels of learning: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation. When you are writing a scholarly paper, the focus should not be on just identifying, comprehending material and applying it, your writing should also reflect analysis, synthesis and evaluation. What this means is that your writing (and your thinking) should be able to: * Break down ideas into parts and see how those parts relate and are organized to demonstrate analysis. * Re-arrange ideas into a new whole to demonstrate synthesis. Make judgments based on internal evidence or external criteria to demonstrate evaluation.\n\n\nStructure and Organization\nWriting a scholarly paper often follows a very distinct organizational structure and includes: a title page, an introduction, methods and results, a discussion and a list of references. Let‚Äôs take a closer look at what should be included in each of these sections of a scholarly paper.\nTitle Page: This is the first page of your paper and it should include a title that summarizes the main topic you will be discussing. It should also include your name (the author), and the institution you are affiliated with (Trinity Western University). It is also helpful if you include the date that you are submitting the assignment.\nAbstract: This the second page of your paper. The purpose of the abstract is for the author to convey the sentiment of the study in a concise yet informative manner. The abstract is used to determine if the reader is interested in the article and wants to retrieve the article for further information. In 250 words, the abstract explicitly states the overall problem and research question, a brief description of the method, a summary of the findings and important conclusions.\nIntroduction: The purpose of an introduction is to inform the reader of the rationale for your research topic. It should provide a brief overview of the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù that you are addressing by providing a broad context, any relevant statistics and describing the importance of your topic. The introduction is also the place where you can define any important terms that may be unfamiliar to the reader and ends with establishing what the key purpose for the paper is. The purpose can be stated as your research question.\nMethods: The methods section outlines specifically what procedures the author chose to do. In a research report this section will include the sampling methods, sample size, measures, research design, and interventions used. The methods section of a research report looks very different than a methods section of a literature review. In a literature review, the methods section will emphasize how you chose the articles and how you evaluated the articles you reviewed. This will include describing any inclusion or exclusion criteria, the databases that were searched, what key search terms were used, how many records were obtained and how many articles were included in the review. You can refer to the APA (2019) manual for a more detailed explanation of the methods section.\nResults: The results section reports the findings of the data analysis of a research report or the critical analysis of a literature review. Please refer to the APA manual (2019) for extensive detail about the results of different empirical research reports.\nDiscussion: In the discussion section, the authors describe their own interpretations of the results and link these interpretations back to the literature that was reviewed. In this section the author may discuss the strengths and limitations of the literature, draw conclusions, and make recommendations for future research on the topic.\nReference List: The reference list provides a precise list of all of the sources you cited within your paper.\nAn example of an APA style paper can be found at the following link:\nAPA Sample Paper - Purdue OWL¬Æ - Purdue University\n\n\n3.2.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read and Practice!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüìñ Read chapter 2 of the APA (2019) manual which discusses the structure and content of an APA style manuscript or paper.\nüì∫ Next, watch the following video on formatting a student paper.

    "text": "3.3 How to Write a Scholarly Paper\nTo begin writing a scholarly paper you need to have a research topic in mind. Then you need to do a review of scholarly literature to obtain a good working knowledge of your topic and then critically evaluate and synthesize the literature you have read. Finally, you need to have an organizational system for presenting what you know about the research topic. The APA (2019) manual provides a clear organizational structure for presenting scholarly information.\nWhen you begin writing, it is important to remember that you are communicating ideas about a topic to a specific audience. In order to convey your ideas well, you need to write clearly and concisely with set of specific guidelines. This is important for two reasons: to keep your reader‚Äôs attention and to make sure your meaning is clear. If your writing is long-winded, you will either lose the interest of your reader or confuse your reader. When your writing is more concise and clear, this will motivate your reader to pay attention to what you have to say.\nThere are also times when you are writing with a specific purpose in mind. For example, to prepare an assignment or a board briefing document. Writing clearly and concisely helps a writer communicate what needs to be said in an efficient and effective way. It is also easy to understand and helps the writer connect with the audience. Here is an excellent resource by the Purdue Owl Writing Center on ‚ÄúTips for Writing in North American Colleges‚Äù(owl.purdue.edu ‚Ä∫ owl ‚Ä∫ tips_for_writing_in_north_american_colleges).

    "section": "3.4 Citing the Ideas of Others",
    "text": "3.4 Citing the Ideas of Others\nWithin each section of a scholarly paper, each paragraph utilizes a combination three types of content: claims, evidence and transitions. Heady states that ‚Äúclaims are the points you want to prove, interpretations you want to offer, and assertions you want to make, whereas, evidence is the material you use to back up your claims‚Äù (pp.¬†74-75). Some examples of types of evidence that may be used to support claims include: ‚Äúquotes from a book, citations from an article, data from a study, personal experience, historical facts, statistics, etc. Transitions are one or two words that help you move from one claim to another‚Äù (pp.¬†74-75).\nAn example of the three types of content (claims, evidence and transitions) included in a paragraph of scholarly writing is provided below from the article ‚ÄúA Systematic Literature Review of Servant Leadership Theory in Organizational Contexts‚Äù by Parris and Peachy (2013, pp.¬†377-378):\n\nOver the years, some leadership scholars have called attention to the implicit connection between ethics and leadership. A burgeoning new research area and leadership theory that has been linked to ethics, virtues and morality is servant leadership (Graham 1991; Lancot and Irving 2010; Parolini et al.¬†2009; Russell 2001; Whetstone, 2002). Despite servant leadership being coined by Robert K. Greenleaf over three decades ago in 1970, it remains understudied yet prominently practiced in boardrooms and organizations (Bass and Bass 2008; Spears 2005).\n\nFrom the example above, you can see that a topic is introduced in the first sentence. A claim with supporting evidence is provided in the second sentence (with references) and the transition begins in the third sentence with the word ‚Äúdespite‚Äù. The third sentence also includes a claim with supporting evidence (references). This paragraph structure is typical of what you would find in scholarly writing. Scholarly writing involves putting your own thoughts and ideas (claims) in context by ensuring that you are citing the ideas of those who have influenced you (APA, 2010, p.169).\nHeady (2013) suggests five general rules you should always follow when you are organizing your paper (p.¬†80):\n\nYou must provide enough background information to give your reader a good working knowledge of your topic.\nYour background information must lead logically to your research question.\nAll claims/ideas/facts must be backed up by evidence.\nAll evidence must be related to a claim/idea/fact.\nIf evidence does not back up a claim, you need to explain why and/or account for it.\n\n\n3.4.1 Learning Activity: Read, Watch and Practice!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüìñ In this learning activity you will begin by reading chapter 8 of the APA manual (7th edition).\nüì∫ Next, watch the following video tutorial ‚ÄúIn-text Citations, Quotations and Plagarism‚Äù by Dr.¬†Forlenza.

    "section": "4.1 What is Servant Leadership?",
    "text": "4.1 What is Servant Leadership?\nTo begin this unit, I want to provide you with a very brief overview of servant leadership because the research articles that I have selected for you to focus on for units 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 are all focused on the topic of servant leadership. I have included articles on servant leadership from the field of education, business, non-profit and health care. Servant leadership, as a concept, has its origins tracing back to the earliest records we have in history. It is not a religious concept, however, it is a concept that you will find is supported by most of the world‚Äôs major religions. For Christians, Jesus Christ is considered the epitome of a servant-leader. In fact servant leadership is fully aligned with the teachings of Christianity. For example, read the following passage from Mark 10:35-45 which states ‚ÄúBut among you it will be different. Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant.‚Äù Mark 10:43 Consider the following reflection on this passage by Mark Roberts (2014). In 1970, Robert Greenleaf began writing about servant leadership in our modern day context in his seminal essay ‚ÄúThe Servant as Leader‚Äù. He stated that ‚Äúservant leadership begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve others first. Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. That person is sharply different from one who is leader first‚Ä¶‚Äù(p.6). Several years later Larry Spears (2010) went on to write an essay that describes the ten characteristics of a servant leader. They are:\n\nListening\nEmpathy\nHealing\nAwareness\nPersuasion\nConceptualization\nForesight\nStewardship\nCommitment to the Growth of People\nBuilding Community\n\nAccording to Sendjaya and Sarros (2002) ‚ÄúThere has been a strong tendency among leadership scholars and journalists to treat leaders as isolated heroes controlling and commanding others from within their ivory tower. In the organizational context, the word ‚Äòleader‚Äô has been mostly ascribed to people who hold management positions and are capable of giving orders to other members of the organization (Senge, 1990)‚Äù. The authors suggest that servant leadership may offer a better alternative.\n\n4.1.1 Learning Actiivty: Watch, Read and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüìñ Read the article by Eva et al., (2019) Servant leadership: A systematic review and call for future research to familiarize yourself with the current state of research on servant leadership.\n‚úèÔ∏è After reading the article, complete the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal.\n\nWhat is already known and not known about servant leadership?\nWhy do you think servant leadership should be of interest researchers in the leadership field?\n\nNote that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 What is a Research Problem?\nAll good research begins with a good research problem. Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) suggest that research problems ‚Äúare the issues, controversies or concerns that demand study‚Äù (p.¬†80). They assert that these are often real problems that must be addressed. Gall, Gall and Borg (2007) suggest that in identifying the research problem, the researcher should consider personal interest, the potential benefits to the researcher‚Äôs professional growth, and potential contribution of the research study to research knowledge. They suggest that all three criteria should be considered, with emphasis on the first and third. Somewhat reflexively, a thorough review of literature on a topic that interests you informs the identification of a good research problem. Gall, Gall and Borg (2007, p.¬†43) suggest that through the process of the literature review, researchers ask themselves the following kinds of questions.\n\nHas research on this problem been done before?\nWhat has been learned?\nWhat more can I contribute?\nHow do my methods compare to those employed by other researchers?\nAre there more compelling research problems to be addressed?\n\nAll of these contribute to answering the ultimate question for any research: ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù As a consumer of research, these sorts of questions can help you identify a good research problem to focus your personal research interest. This narrowing of research interest, or research problem, is a process that is refined as you read over a variety of different sources of literature.\n\n\n4.1.3 Learning Activity: Watch, Read, and Reflect!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüì∫ To begin this learning activity, watch the following three videos.\n\nWatch: Starting a Systematic Review\nWatch: An Introduction to Writing a Systematic Review - Laurie Theeke ‚Äì Sept 2017\nWatch: Finding Studies for Systematic Reviews\n\nüìñ Re-read chapter 2, ‚ÄúBeginning the process of research in leadership,‚Äù in the Rosch, Kniffin, and Guthrie (2023) text to help you understand what the statement of the problem is and what to look for in a high-quality article.\n‚úèÔ∏è In your reflective learning journal, practice evaluating the quality of a study‚Äôs statement of the problem of the Eva et al., article.\n\nIn your learning journal, identify what your overall quality rating is of this section and list three pieces of evidence to support your rating.\n\nNote that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit.",

    "section": "4.2 What is a Literature Review?",
    "text": "4.2 What is a Literature Review?\nThe research problem establishes why a particular research study is worth doing. The review of the literature supports this by establishing what is already known about the problem and summarizes what scholarship has already established regarding the research problem. This has many facets that go beyond merely establishing the research purpose. As we will see, a literature review affects every aspect of a research study and its final report. For that reason, one of the most important preliminary steps in the process of scholarly inquiry is doing a thorough review of the precedent academic literature on a given topic. A precedent literature review is the process of locating, obtaining, reading and evaluating the research and theoretical literature in your area of interest. Bordens and Abbott (2005) outline several important reasons for a researcher to conduct a precedent literature review:\n\nTo avoid needless duplication of effort. By becoming familiar with an area of study through a review of the literature, the researcher can avoid ‚Äúre-inventing the wheel.‚Äù The researcher‚Äôs specific question or topic may already have been thoroughly addressed and answered. In the case of research designed for application, a review of literature provides a rich resource of information upon which to draw and apply to the chosen context.\nTo clarify the design of research. Designing a study involves decisions regarding which concepts or variables are most germane and how to define, measure, or describe them. The published literature provides the researcher with a rich resource of information about each of these dimensions. The researcher may also find established procedures or existing materials (e.g., a survey tool) that would inform their research.\nTo update the researcher on the current state of knowledge in a particular field. Researchers must be up to date on current empirical or theoretical advances and controversies in a particular area.\n\nGall, Gall & Borg (2007, pp.¬†96-97) provide a similar but expanded list of reasons for the researcher to conduct a thorough review of precedent literature:\n\nDelimiting the research problem. Generally, it is advantageous to the researcher to investigate a limited problem in depth as opposed to doing a superficial study over a broad area. Review of precedent research will give you insight into how other researchers have focused their inquiry within a broad field.\nSeeking new lines of inquiry. A thorough review of precedent literature will not only reveal what has been done in a given area of interest, but will also, perhaps more importantly, reveal what has been overlooked. This is valuable information for a potential researcher and is a major driver of new research.\nAvoiding fruitless approaches. The cause of scholarship is not advanced by the multiplication of research studies based on the same methodological paradigm that continues to report no significant effect, and the researcher who adds to such a litany clearly demonstrates that he or she has not done an adequate review of precedent literature. As a wise and discerning consumer of research, you want to avoid wasting your time with fruitless approaches.\nGaining methodological insights. Researchers can find important ideas as to how they can design their research to be more fruitful. As a wise consumer of research, you may consider looking for reports using a variety of research methods.\nIdentifying recommendations for further research. For both the researcher and the discerning consumer of research, the section of research reports that makes recommendations for further research can be a gold mine.\n\nA precedent literature review that is useful and instructive exhibits the following features:\n\nthe writer‚Äôs clarity of purpose and focus of the research question\nthe thoroughness of the writer‚Äôs search\nthe quality and reliability of the writer‚Äôs sources\nthe degree to which the writer provides synthesis (i.e., relates research studies to one another and to the paper‚Äôs thesis and purpose in meaningful ways)\nthe objectivity of the writer in selecting, interpreting, organizing and summarizing the research he or she has reviewed.\n\n\n4.2.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read, and Reflect!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüì∫ In this learning activity, begin by watching the following videos:\n\nWatch: Conducting a Systematic Literature Review\n\n\n\nWatch: What are Systematic Reviews and Literature Reviews\n\n\nüìñ Next, read chapter 4 ‚ÄúConducting a literature review‚Äù in the Rosch, Kniffin, and Guthrie (2023) text.\n‚úèÔ∏è Practice evaluating the quality of a study‚Äôs literature review, using the Eva et al., article.

Typically, the research purpose is further refined into a limited number of research questions or predictions (hypotheses) that the researcher will address. Taken together, these three common elements in introductions to research reports combine in such a way as to ‚Äúpose significant questions that can be answered empirically‚Äù (Gall, Gall & Borg, 2007, p.¬†35). As a consumer of research, you are vitally interested in the answers research reports offer to your significant questions. Identification of the research problem and review of precedent literature leads directly to specifying the purpose of the study. The purpose will then provide direction for selection of the research design, data collection, analysis of data in determining findings or results and finally in the interpretation and evaluation of the research.\n\n4.3.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read and Reflect!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚úèÔ∏è Practice evaluating the quality of a study‚Äôs purpose statement/research question, using the Eva et al., article.

    "section": "5.1 Introduction to Quantitative and Qualitative Research Design",
    "text": "5.1 Introduction to Quantitative and Qualitative Research Design\nIn this unit we will explore the next major section of a research report: The methods and results section. We will see that the methods section indicates the overall plan for how the research was conducted, how the data was collected, and what the analysis of the data tells us. These may be termed research design, method, and analysis and results, respectively. In unit 5 we will be looking at the methods and results sections of quantitative research reports. Once again we start with the reminder that we are reviewing these materials in order to become an informed consumer of research, rather than research experts. Before we get into the specifics of the methods and results of quantitative research reports, it would be helpful to take a step back and remind ourselves of some of the features of the broader research landscape.\nBy now you should be familiar with the terms quantitative research and qualitative research. Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) assert that these research approaches are suited to different kinds of research questions: a quantitative research approach is indicated when the research problem requires explanation, while a qualitative research approach is indicated when the research problem requires exploration (p.¬†85). Expanding on that somewhat, Leedy and Ormrod assert that quantitative research has three purposes: to explain and predict, to confirm and validate, and to test theory. In contrast, qualitative research has three distinct purposes: to describe and explain, to explore and interpret, and to build theory (Leedy & Ormrod, 2010, p.¬†96). These differing research purposes find expression in differing research processes, the kinds of data gathered, the approaches to data analysis, and finally in the ways findings are communicated.\nIn this unit we will be looking at the methods and results sections of quantitative research reports, and in unit 6 we will do the same for qualitative research reports. We will see that there are a variety of different research designs under both of these general approaches. For example, Gill and Johnson (2002) have developed a helpful continuum (see the figure below) that describes the relative emphasis of various research designs on selected characteristics. They argue that quantitative designs (including survey research) tend towards deduction while qualitative designs are inductive in nature.\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5.1: Gill and Johnson‚Äôs continuum of research design emphases\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Leedy and Ormrod, the nature of quantitative and qualitative research designs differ (2010, p.¬†96). Quantitative designs tend to be more closely focused on a problem that has known variables that can be controlled or at least accounted for. The investigation is conducted following established guidelines utilizing largely predetermined methods while the researcher seeks to maintain a detached view. In contrast, qualitative designs tend to be more holistic, investigating unknown variables following flexible guidelines utilizing emergent methods in a highly context-bound, personal approach. Qualitative designs may be characterized as evolving and flexible, sometimes guided by a general hunch as to how to proceed (Bogdan & Biklen, 2007, p.¬†45).\nThese differing designs lead to marked differences in what data are collected, how data are collected, and how data are analyzed. Quantitative research seeks to collect numeric data from as large a sample as possible so to enhance claims to being representative, using standardized data collection instruments. Qualitative research gathers textual or image-based data from typically small, informative samples using loosely structured or non-standardized interviews or observations (Leedy & Ormrod, 2010, p.¬†96).\nThe differing designs of quantitative and qualitative research also lead to marked differences in how data are analyzed. Quantitative data is approached primarily through deductive reasoning, employing statistical analyses applied to numerical data, with stress on objectivity. Qualitative data is approached primarily through inductive reasoning with the goal being to uncover themes and categories, with acknowledgement of potential researcher bias and subjectivity. Typically, quantitative research findings are reported in a formal, scientific style with full display of numbers and statistics, while qualitative research findings are typically reported in a narrative form (Leedy & Ormrod, 2010, p.¬†96). In the following sections, we will explore this somewhat for quantitative research.\n\n5.1.1 Learning Activity: Watch and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüì∫ To begin this learning activity, watch the following video Qualitative & Quantitative Research - An Introduction.\nWatch: Qualitative & Quantitative Research - An Introduction\n\n‚úèÔ∏è After reading the chapters assigned, complete the questions for this learning activity in your reflective learning journal.\n\nDiscuss the differences between qualitative and quantitative research reports.\nWhat did you learn that you did not already know about servant leadership?\nWhat are the potential challenges for studying servant leadership using a quantitative research approach?\n\nNote that your journal is not graded, but will help you in your assessment for this unit.",

    "section": "5.2 Quantitative Research Designs",
    "text": "5.2 Quantitative Research Designs\nQuantitative research designs typically rely on the researcher beginning with a theoretical (or conceptual) framework that will determine what concepts the researcher chooses to investigate, the research questions, and the framing of research findings (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p.¬†39). These frameworks lead to a structured, predetermined, formal, and specifically detailed plan of operation (Bogdan & Biklen, 2007, p.¬†45).\nIn Chapter 6 and 7, Rosch, Kniffen and Guthrie (2023) discuss five quantitative research designs. Experiments‚Äîparticularly randomized control trials (RCTs)‚Äîare often held up as the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù of research, meeting the criteria of randomization, control, and manipulation of variables (i.e., experimental procedures, treatments, or interventions). In the domain of knowledge transfer and evidence-based practice, RCTs are considered as the highest level or most reliable form of evidence. For further understanding see the following video by David Schwartz ‚ÄúNot All Scientific Studies are Created Equal‚Äù.\n\nBy way of caution, Gill and Johnson (2002) observe that management and leadership research seldom employs true experimentation. Having said this, there is relevance for us because the logic underpinning experimental research applies to other types of deductive research that are more common in management and leadership research. When not all of the rigorous standards required of experiments can be applied to a study, researchers approximate some of the logic of the experiment with quasi-experimental designs.\nIn true experimental and quasi-experimental designs, the researcher intentionally introduces an intervention, and then seeks to measure the response to that intervention. The main difference between experimental and quasi-experimental designs lies in the way sampling is done. In non-experimental quantitative research designs, the researcher seeks to understand the behavior or attributes of the study sample without any researcher intervention. The terms descriptive and correlational are often applied to these types of quantitative research designs.\nAs a consumer of research reports, you can usually find an indication of what research methodology is employed in the abstract of a research study. This is important information for you to identify, as you will quickly develop a sense of what to expect as you continue to read. This sense is important as you critique the research report, and make value judgments as to its worth.\n\nA Note About Survey Research\nAt this point we want to focus on survey research for a few moments because of its wide use in leadership and management settings. While the survey is a method of data collection that may be used in qualitative research (Gall, Gall & Borg, 2007, p.¬†227), it is extensively employed in quantitative research (Rosch, Kniffen and Guthrie, 2023). Be aware of ambiguities in how the term survey is used (see ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a Tip!‚Äù on page 207). Often the term is used as a general label to denote the use of questionnaires or interviews in research. Because of the differences in intentions for generalizability between quantitative and qualitative research, this ambiguity is not helpful.\nSurvey research is a popular research method used to generalize from a sample to a population in order that inferences can be made about some characteristic, attitude, or behavior of the larger population (Creswell, 2003). Survey research may be conducted through use of either questionnaires or interviews. These methods allow the researcher to collect data about observable phenomena as well as phenomena that would be difficult to otherwise assess (i.e., opinions, values, feelings, etc.). Questionnaires present the same questions in some form of print to all study participants uniformly, and responses are received in like manner. In interviews, the researcher presents the same questions orally to study participants, usually one at a time, but increasingly in groups, and the responses are received orally. The main difference in the two approaches lies in the fact that with questionnaires the research participant is largely in control of the response situation, whereas in the interview the researcher is largely in control. Each approach has relative advantages and disadvantages, but share in common the desire to collect data in standardized ways. For this reason, closed ended questions are typically used.\nAs a consumer of survey research reports, be vigilant for potential issues of validity and reliability. Validity is a term that forces us to question the likelihood of whether the instrument or study measure actually measures what the researcher says it does. Reliability issues concern the consistency or repeatability of the instrument. Be aware that survey research is commonly criticized on these grounds.\n\n\n5.2.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read, and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüì∫ Begin this learning activity by watching the following video\nWatch:QUANTITATIVE Research Design: Everything You Need To Know (With Examples)\n\nüìñ Next, read chapter 6 and 7, in Rosch, Kniffen and Guthrie (2023).\n‚úèÔ∏è Practice evaluating the quality of a study‚Äôs research design, using the quality criteria discussed in TRosch, Kniffen and Guthrie (2023) to evaluate the quality of the research design.\n‚úèÔ∏è Finally, in your learning journal, identify what your overall quality rating is of this section and list three pieces of evidence to support your rating.

    "section": "5.3 Quantitative Data Collection",
    "text": "5.3 Quantitative Data Collection\nWhen researchers are collecting data for a quantitative research study, they need to address two important questions: who is the data being collected from, and how are they collecting it? In answering the first question, the terms population and sample are salient. Population is the large category that encompasses all of the individuals who possess or exhibit certain characteristics of interest. Quantitative data is usually collected from large samples, selected ideally through random selection.\nSample refers to the individuals from the population that you actually gather data from. The goal in sampling is to find a representative sample that accurately represents that population. In quantitative research, a primary interest of researchers is in generalizability: which is to what degree can the results of our research study be generalized back to the population? This generalization is called external validity and requires an inferential leap from the sample back to the population.\nIn quantitative research, samples are drawn from the population through processes of probability sampling and non-probability sampling techniques. A number of sampling techniques are discussed by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) in Chapter 7. The gold standard is a true random sample of the population. This is where everyone gets an equal opportunity to be selected as a representative sample, and this is known as probability sampling.\nThe second major consideration in qualitative data collection is how the data is collected. In quantitative research, data collection instruments and tools are used most often to capture variables of interest. This may include using inventories, questionnaires, indexes, scales and test scores (Bogdan & Biklen, 2007, p.¬†46). As a consumer of research, when judging the quality of tests used in research consider the criteria of fairness, generalizability, cognitive complexity, content quality, meaningfulness, content coverage and cost and efficiency (p.¬†217).\nA variable is anything that can vary, i.e.¬†changed or be changed, such as eating behaviour or time taken to perform a task. There are three types of variables that are usually found in experimental investigations: the dependent variable (or outcome), the independent variable (treatment/predictor) and counfounding variable (extraneous factors that could affect the results) .\nIn an experiment, the researcher is looking for the possible effect on the dependent variable that might be caused by changing the independent variable, while controlling for extraneous variables (Bogdan & Biklen, 2007, p.¬†45). These are all variables, which are not the independent variable, but could affect the results of the experiment.\n\nWhat Is Research Ethics?\nAccording to Walton (n.d.), ‚Äúresearch that involves human participants raises unique and complex ethical, legal, social and political issues. There are three objectives in research ethics. The first and broadest objective is to protect human participants. The second objective is to ensure that research is conducted in a way that serves interests of individuals, groups and/or society as a whole. Finally, the third objective is to examine specific research activities and projects for their ethical soundness, looking at issues such as the management of risk, protection of confidentiality and the process of informed consent‚Äù.\nBefore a researcher can start collecting information from participants, the research proposal must undergoe ethical review. In Canada, all academic institutions and health authorities have a Research Ethics Board (REB) and in the U.S. the same institutions have Institutional Review Boards (IRB) that conduct the reviews. The purpose of the ethical review process is to ‚Äúensure that research is planned and conducted in accordance with laws and regulatory standards. In protecting the rights and welfare of participants, REBs must weigh possible harms to individuals against the plausible societal benefits of the research. They must ensure fair participant selection and, where applicable, confirm that appropriate provisions are in place for obtaining participant consent‚Äù (Page & Nyeboer, 2017, para. 2).\n\n\nWhat Is Informed Consent? by usc Oprs\nInformed Consent is a voluntary agreement to participate in research. It is not merely a form that is signed but is a process, in which the participant has an understanding of the research and its risks. Informed consent is essential before enrolling a participant and ongoing once enrolled. Informed Consent must be obtained for all types of human research including; diagnostic, therapeutic, interventional, social and behavioral studies, and for research conducted domestically or abroad. Obtaining consent involves informing the participant about his or her rights, the purpose of the study, the procedures to be undergone, and the potential risks and benefits of participation. Participants in the study must participate willingly. Vulnerable populations (i.e.¬†prisoners, children, pregnant women, etc.) must receive extra protections. The goal of the informed consent process is to provide sufficient information so that a participant can make an informed decision about whether or not to enroll in a study or to continue participation.\n\n\n5.3.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read, and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüì∫ Begin this learning activity by watching the following video: Watch:Quantitative Data Collection Techniques\n\nüìñ Next, read chapter 7, in Rosch, Kniffen and Guthrie (2023).\n‚úèÔ∏è Practice evaluating the quality of a quantitative study‚Äôs participants and data collection.\nUse the quality criteria discussed in Rosch, Kniffen and Guthrie (2023) to evaluate the quality of the participants and data collection.\n‚úèÔ∏è Finally, in your learning journal, identify what your overall quality rating is of this section and list three pieces of evidence to support your rating.

    "text": "5.4 Quantitative Data Analysis and Results\nQuantitative research data analysis is generally deductive, occurs at the conclusion of data collection and is statistical (Bogdan and Biklen, 2007, p.¬†46). An in-depth understanding or even an overview of statistical analysis is outside the parameters of this course. However, even if you do not have a background in statistics, you must find your way through what can initially appear to be a daunting discussion.\nThe methods section of a quantitative research report typically presents a brief description of various statistical analysis of data. The statistical analysis chosen depends on the kind of questions asked in the research. Descriptive statistics include various measures of central tendency (including mean, median, mode, skewness, and categorical data such as frequency distribution), measures of variability (including standard deviation, the normal curve, variance and range) and correlational statistics (including bivariate and multivariate correlational methods). Inferential statistics are applied to data in an effort to answer comparison and relationship sorts of questions.\nAs a consumer of qualitative research reports, you will want to know that the statistics employed are appropriate, and to be cautious about accepting research findings if you detect any inconsistencies.\n\n5.4.0.1 Additional Resources\nI wanted to provide you with a few extra resources to help you understand Quantitative Analysis and Results.\nHere is a link to a really helpful website created by Dr.¬†Andy Field.

    "section": "6.1 Qualitative Research Design",
    "text": "6.1 Qualitative Research Design\nThis week in Unit 6 you will be exploring a different approach to research: qualitative research methods. Rosch, Kniffen and Guthrie define qualitative research as procedures for collecting, analyzing, and reporting text and image by exploring participant views.\nQualitative research has three distinct purposes: to describe, to explore, and to build theory. Quantitative research and qualitative research designs differ significantly in what data are collected, how data are collected, how data are analyzed and how findings are reported.\nAs someone who was trained as a quantitative researcher, I would sometimes hear people in my discipline discredit the qualitative approach to research. However, as qualitative research has become more mainstream over the last 20 years, now I would say the most widely held opinion is that there is no best method. ‚ÄúIt all depends on what you are studying and what you want to find out‚Äù (Bogdan & Biklen, 2007, p.¬†43). I can certainly appreciate understanding a problem or a phenomenon from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective. For example, in order to understand the complexity and ‚Äúmessiness‚Äù of real-life organizations, it is important for leaders to not just rely only on statistics, but to also examine what employees, consumers, and leaders have to say from a qualitative perspective.\nIt is really important that you read through the textbook chapters on quantitative (chapters 6, 7) and qualitative research (8, 9) so you understand the distinct differences in the two approaches.\nQualitative research was ‚Äúmainstreamed‚Äù in recent years, though understanding the complexity and ‚Äúmessiness‚Äù of real-life organizations, leadership investigation is turning increasingly to qualitative research.\nQualitative research designs typically are less structured than in quantitative designs, and are far more flexible. In contrast to quantitative research design‚Äôs resting solidly on theoretical frameworks, in qualitative research design the use of theoretical frameworks is not nearly so clear. While some qualitative researchers do employ theoretical frameworks, at least to some degree, others, such as Corbin and Strauss ‚Äúprefer not to begin our research with a predefined theoretical framework or set of concepts‚Äù (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p.¬†39). Consequently, qualitative research design has been characterized as an ‚Äúevolving, flexible, general hunch as to how you might proceed‚Äù (Bogdan & Biklen, 2007, p.¬†45). Theoretical frameworks are employed in qualitative research design to suggest alternate explanations, to help the researcher determine appropriate methodology, and to provide the basis for building and extending theory. The primary consideration for the qualitative researcher is that they remain ‚Äúopen‚Äù to new ideas and concepts that might not fit the concepts of the adopted theoretical framework (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p.¬†40).\n\n6.1.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read, and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüì∫ Begin this learning activity by watching the following video: *Watch: QUALITATIVE Research Design: Everything You Need To Know (With Examples)\n\nüìñ Next, read chapter 9, ‚ÄúStructure and Design of Qualitative Research‚Äù in Rosch, Kniffen and Guthrie (2023).\nüìñ Then, read the article by Ragnarsson, Kristj√°nsd√≥ttir, & Gunnarsd√≥ttir (2018).

    "text": "6.2 Qualitative Data Collection\nQualitative research data collection is typically based on one or more of the following methods: observation (including participant observation), open-ended interviewing, first person accounts, and the review of various documents. Data collected is descriptive, and may consist of personal documents, field notes, various records of people‚Äôs own words (including video and voice recordings and written transcripts), photographs, official documents, and other artifacts. Data is collected from small, non-representative samples selected through various sampling strategies including theoretical, purposeful, and snow ball sampling (Bogdan & Biklen, 2007, p.¬†45).\nA dominant word encountered in qualitative research is triangulation. Triangulation is a term borrowed from navigation and surveying, and conveys the notion that multiple sources of information will help establish a fact (Bogdan & Biklen, 2007, p.¬†115). Multiple sources of data are seen to lead to a fuller, more complete, and more defensible understanding of the phenomena observed. Consequently, multiple methods of data collection are frequently employed within the same qualitative research study. These commonly consist of the researcher‚Äôs field notes, interviews, researcher observations, and analysis of various documents.\nIn qualitative research, data is usually collected until saturation is achieved. Saturation is a term employed that simply means that no new information relevant to the development of categories, properties, dimensions and variances is forthcoming from continued data gathering (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p.¬†143). In effect, findings begin to replicate, and not add anything substantially new (Gall, Gall & Borg, 2007, p.¬†278).

    "section": "6.3 Qualitative Data Analysis and Findings",
    "text": "6.3 Qualitative Data Analysis and Findings\nQualitative research data analysis typically employs analytic induction, is ongoing throughout the research, and seeks to identify themes and concepts emergent in the data (Bogdan & Biklen, 2007, p.¬†46). This is a dynamic process in which the researcher breaks data apart into its various components in order to identify their properties and dimensions (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p.¬†46). Because data might suggest more than one story, analysis is an interpretive act that often begins, as in Glaser and Strauss‚Äô constant comparison, from the very onset of data collection (Gall, Gall & Borg, 2007, p.¬†469).\nData analysis involves ‚Äúworking with the data, organizing them, breaking them into manageable units, coding them, synthesizing them, and searching for patterns‚Äù (Bogdan & Biklen, 2007, p.¬†159). Analysis involves data interpretation where ideas about the findings are related to broader concerns and concepts. Levels of analysis can range from the superficial description to theoretical interpretation (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p.¬†80). The task is monumental. Software such as HyperRESEARCH¬© is of great assistance in helping the researcher assign codes to text data, which assists in the identification of concepts and themes. Qualitative research findings or results are usually presented in a narrative form. This can take many forms, and be organized in a variety of ways including the use of tables and figures when appropriate. Chapter 11 of the course text provides a concise discussion of this topic.\nBecause qualitative research can involve the investigation of as few as one research participant (as in a case study), great caution is exercised in making sweeping generalizations. In fact, because the term generalizability itself is strongly associated with quantitative research with much larger samples, Gall, Gall and Borg suggest the term applicability is more appropriate to the different processes and types of evidence associated with qualitative research (2008, p.¬†477).\n\n6.3.1 Learning Activity: Watch, Read, and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüì∫ Begin this learning activity, by watching the following videos:\n\nQualitative Data Analysis 101 Tutorial: 6 Analysis Methods + Examples - Watch video\n\n \n\nQualitative Coding Tutorial: How To Code Qualitative Data For Analysis (4 Steps + Examples) - Watch video\n\n\n\nWatch: Qualitative Content Analysis 101: The What, Why & How (With Examples)\n\n\n\nWatch: Thematic Analysis in Qualitative Research: Simple Explanation with Examples (+ Free Template)\n\n\n\nWatch: Thematic Analysis In Qualitative Research: 6 Time-Saving Tips (+ Examples)\n\n\nüìñ Next, read chapter 9, ‚ÄúStructure and Design of Qualitative Research‚Äù in Rosch, Kniffen, and Guthrie (2023).\n‚úèÔ∏èPractice evaluating the data analysis and findings of the Ragnarsoson et al., article.

    "section": "7.2 Mixed-Methods Research Designs",
    "text": "7.2 Mixed-Methods Research Designs\nA wide variety of mixed methods research designs have been used by researchers. It is common in mixed methods designs to see the researchers count (quantify) certain kinds of qualitative data. As well, you will encounter quantitative researchers reporting how their research participants perceived or were emotionally impacted (i.e.¬†qualitative data) by the experimental treatment (Leedy & Ormrod, 2013, p.¬†97). As you look at mixed methods designs, notice how the following considerations help to differentiate the four variations of mixed methods that Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) distinguish:\n\nWhat is the purpose of needing qualitative and quantitative data?\nWhat is the sequence of qualitative and quantitative data collection?\nWhat is the priority of the qualitative and quantitative data?\nHow do the two data sets inform each other?\n\nFor example in a convergent parallel design, only one data collection phase is used, during which quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis are conducted separately yet concurrently. This design is used to develop a more complete understanding of a topic or phenomenon. In an embedded (concurrent nested) design, only one data collection phase is used, during which a predominant method (quantitative or qualitative) nests or embeds the other less priority method (qualitative or quantitative, respectively). This design is used o gain broader and in-depth perspectives on a topic. The sequential explanatory design involves the collection and analysis of quantitative data followed by the collection and analysis of qualitative data. This design is used to help explain, interpret or contextualize quantitative findings. The sequential exploratory design involves the collection and analysis of qualitative data followed by quantitative data collection and analysis. This designed is used to explore a phenomenon and to expand on qualitative findings.\n\n7.2.1 Activity: Watch, Read, and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüì∫ Begin this learning activity by watching the following video on Mixed-Methods research designs.\nWatch: Types of Mixed Methods Research Designs ~GM Lectures\n\nüìñ Next, read the article by Beck (2014).

Molina-Azor√≠n and Cameron (2015) have highlighted four ways that mixed methods research can benefit business research and this can be applied to leadership studies. For example mixed methods can be beneficial for leadership studies because:\n\nCollecting qualitative data can provide a deeper understanding of the leadership context.\nAttention to both process and outcome through the use of mixed methods can aid in building theory. For example qualitative findings can provide insight into what mechanisms contribute to a measured outcome.\nComplex organizations with different leadership roles would benefit from analyses that are integrated across micro and macro levels.\nThe use of mixed methods can help bridge the academic-practitioner divide through enhancing the interpretation of results.

    "section": "8.1 Issues of Credibility",
    "text": "8.1 Issues of Credibility\nCongratulations! You have made it to the final week of LDRS 591: Scholarly Inquiry! This week you will be revisiting a question about making informed decisions, discussing why evidence-based decision making is important for the Transformational Servant Leader, and reflecting on what your expectations are now for a high quality research report. You will also be introduced to the MA Lead: Leadership Integration Project (LDRS 697/698).\nBefore we finish this course, I want to take some time to address a fundamental question that underlies our decision-making processes: Simply stated, the question is ‚Äúhow can I know I can trust what I am reading?‚Äù At the heart of this issue are three interrelated concerns: Is the research work performed competently? Is it reported honestly? Are the findings presented consistent with what other researchers would conclude (Locke, et al., 2010, p.¬†12)? By now you are aware that the reason behind much of the tedious detail provided in research reports is aimed at addressing the question ‚Äúis the research performed competently?‚Äù Great efforts are expended in the publication process to further address research competence, honesty, and consistency. As we will see, the final concern introduces an element that can be distressing.\n\nCompetence and Honesty\nYou will recall that earlier in the course it was suggested that you always check the ‚ÄúPeer-Reviewed or Scholarly‚Äù box when doing an online search of the literature. Your first line of establishing trust in the quality of a research article is the review process followed in the formal presentation and publishing of research.\nTypically, the first opportunity a researcher has to disseminate their work is when their PhD dissertation is defended and subsequently published. The process involved in the successful defense of a dissertation is lengthy and strenuous, to say the very least. In effect, all three questions are addressed by the dissertation committee, which functions, at that stage, as a committee of peers. Beyond that, another first opportunity is to present papers at conferences. Such papers are typically presented beforehand to a jury of peers who critique the paper with the above three criteria in mind. Journal publication extends the processes of peer review even beyond that of conferences. Typically, articles submitted for publication are reviewed by peers who are experts in the field, often blind (the author does not know who the reviewers are or the reviewer does not know who the author is) or double-blind (neither the author nor reviewer are known to each other). This process results in juried or refereed or peer-reviewed articles that are subsequently published. The peer-reviewing process is intended to eliminate work which is flawed in fundamental ways. However, this process is not infallible. Consider this honest statement:\n\nWe must caution you, however, that it is not safe to believe that peer review operates with flawless precision as an absolute guarantor of quality in published research. The effectiveness of the peer review system can be no better than the quality of function produced by each part, and, despite the best efforts of editors and reviewers, judgments fail and mistakes do occur. Taken across journals, editors, and reviewers, there is enough residual variability to give all readers cause to be wary and to exercise one final step in quality control‚Äîby forming their own judgment about the adequacy of what they read. (Locke, et al., 2010, p.¬†35).\n\nBe aware that all journals are not equally selective. Every discipline has front-line journals that have the highest standards of selectivity, and equally, every discipline has journals that are remarkable for their lack of selectivity. You can get some insight into what you are dealing with if you check the requirements for document submission that are embedded somewhere in every journal. Often, you can gain insight by looking at who the editors and reviewers are, and finally, the reputation of the journal is important.\nThe reputation of the author of the article is also very important. Academic credentials, academic honors, holding positions of influence, association with major discoveries and longevity in the field are important factors in establishing authorial reputation. These are major considerations in deciding whether a particular author‚Äôs work is foundational in a given field.\nAnother positive indicator of research quality is if the research is funded from a prestigious funding source. Ford, Carnegie, and Pew Foundations meet those criteria, as do studies funded by the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR), National Institute of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC) . The criteria for funding from prestigious funding sources meet or exceed those for prestigious journals. Related, scholarly organizations often provide funds, or at least endorse research studies. In the field of education, the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD) is but one such organization. In the social sciences, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) is another.\nAs you read research, there are some potential ‚Äúdeal-breakers‚Äù to be aware of. First, although no study will be technically perfect, beware of studies with obvious technical problems. The evaluation matrices, particularly for the introduction, methods and results sections, provided by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) are great places to begin. Studies with numerous technical problems make trust difficult to sustain.\nSampling: Sampling is one of the technical aspects of research that deserves separate mention. Sampling lies at the very heart of a given research study. Two primary issues are at stake here: Does the sample truly represent the population? Does the sample allow for the generalizing of results?\nReplication: One of the strengths of the development of scholarly literature is the reinforcement of the veracity of findings through replication studies. A number of years ago the world was shaken by the announcement by Pons and Fleischmann of the achievement of a cold-fusion nuclear reaction. The problem was, not a single researcher was able to replicate this, and eventually the researcher‚Äôs methods were exposed as flawed.\nResearcher Bias: Clearly, obvious conflicts of interest with the researcher contribute to the breaking of trust. Foundational to the integrity of the research process is that the researcher be an independent, free agent. While it is normal for researchers to find results that are consistent for what was hoped for, trust is violated when the researcher has a personal vested interest in a particular favorable outcome. Locke, et al.¬†correctly observe, ‚ÄúIt is when the benefits become tangible rather than just intellectual that there is reason for special caution‚Äù (2010, p.¬†47). For that reason, it is always wise to be cautious about studies released by organizations rather than the study author. Finally, more subtle conflicts of interest emerge when personal biases of the investigator remain unacknowledged and unaccounted for. Included might be issues of theoretical commitments, beliefs and ideological dispositions that influence the research process such that the research itself becomes a tool for advancing the researcher‚Äôs personal agenda. Included in this is the accusation that the researcher ‚Äúfound what he/she was looking for.‚Äù\nFinally, obvious errors either due to carelessness or poor researcher decisions contribute to the erosion of trust. Poor scholarship is evident when such errors are sufficient to call into question whether the researcher has even a basic understanding of the field.\n\n\n8.1.1 Learning Activity: Watch and Reflect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have spent a great deal of time wrestling with the specifics of research reports, and in so doing, you have developed set of expectations regarding the quality of research reports and you have increased your ability to sense potential problems.
